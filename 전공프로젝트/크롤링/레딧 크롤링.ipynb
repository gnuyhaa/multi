      "[' General Discussion Hub\\n\\nWelcome  to the INFJ hub! Where ideas, connections, and questions can be  discussed freely. The hub fosters discussion of personal topics and  other general content that don’t have to relate to MBTI, such as:\\n\\n* Q&amp;A for the INFJ community\\n* Advice for relationships, career decisions, and self-improvement\\n* Self-expression\\n* Mental and Physical Health/Wellness\\n* Mentorship\\n* Helping others in need\\n\\nYou may also want to stop by [our wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/wiki/index) and [our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/wiki/index) pages for more information. We have hall-of-fame posts that garnered much engagement and insight from the redditors before you.\\n\\nPlease enjoy your stay.\\n\\n*It  is particularly important to distinguish the difference between MBTI  and mental illness - INFJs are not inherently unwell, maladjusted,  depressed, pathological people-pleasers, socially anxious, or the  product of abuse or otherwise \"damaged\", and people with mental illness  are technically not typable under the MBTI system. Please remember that  any advice given here cannot replace real medical advice.*', ' \\n\\nHello and welcome to our 2nd monthly appreciation day!\\n\\nAppreciation day was first established for the purpose of limiting negativity around the community, and promoting a more positive outlook on life. \\n\\nBeing INFJ does not make you depressed or superior by any means, and if you do feel the things mentioned above, please see a psychiatrist, since we are no experts in the field. \\n\\nFor this month’s appreciation day, we will be briefly covering the two minute rule. \\n\\nThe two minute rule is a strategy used to stop procrastination and to pick up new habits. The concept is simple: you simplify your goal to something you can do in two minutes, and do that. The idea is that by doing so, it will be easier to start; it’s comparatively easy to pick up your textbook and read one sentence(on second thought, one sentence may be a bit too much of an oversimplification, even for this oversimplified task) when compared to studying an entire chapter. The idea is to take out your textbook, start reading that one sentence, and from there, continue working on. \\n\\nIf you’re trying to read a book, it’s easy to get lost in the story and read for a solid hour straight. However, what isn’t so easy is getting started and taking out your book. If your mindset is to clear out one whole our of your day to read, that’s intimidating. Instead, by oversimplifying it down to the bare minimum, you can make yourself get started, as since your book is already out and your laptop is already closed, you might as well read instead of mindlessly browsing YouTube until you realise how late it’s gotten(happens to the best of us). As James Clear writes it, “The point is to master the habit of showing up.“ \\n\\nIf you’re in a situation similar to mine where you intend on writing a big project but don’t know where to start, force yourself to look into the topic for a few minutes, and if you feel like it, continue from there. That’s how I shamelessly wrote this month’s appreciation post in the span of one hour when I’ve been telling myself to write this for the past week. If you’re in school, you can make yourself get out your study notes and resources, and continue on from there. If you’re trying to learn an instrument, take it out and play a scale. This concept can be applied in basically every situation where you want to get yourself to do something, and basically works out as a mindset to make yourself achieve the things you’ve said you would before going back to bed and start experiencing a midlife crisis. \\n\\nTo sum up everything in a short paragraph, the two minute rule is where you oversimplify things to the bare minimum to make yourself start working on something, before continuing to plough on. The idea is to make it less intimidating and easier to get into, making you accomplish your goal of getting started easier, and since you’ve started the job you may as well finish it. If you procrastinate, hopefully this will at least be a step in the direction of not, and if you don’t procrastinate, please teach the rest of us the way. \\n\\nFor today’s appreciation day, try to comment something nice that happened to you the past month. Now, if you excuse me, I have a page to read. But just one more episode of anime before that. \\n\\nThank you for reading! \\n\\nSources: [https://jamesclear.com/how-to-stop-procrastinating](https://jamesclear.com/how-to-stop-procrastinating)\\n\\n“*The future depends on what we do in the present.*” -Gandhi', 'Honestly, I know this may be a loaded question but it has to be asked. All answers and opinions welcome. I’m truly curious about this!!', 'Is it just me who get emotionally invested in people’s life so easily? Both platonically and romantically. Even to strangers sometimes. Every time someone opens up to me, I would get so sad and get worried about them and sometimes I care too much about them too.\\n\\nFor example, I met this guy on a Discord server and we talked almost every other day, one day he disappeared and I got genuinely worried and checked on him. He then confided in me and opened up about what happened. I felt so bad for him and just wanted to be there so I constantly checking up on him to see how he was doing. He seemed so appreciative at first but then few weeks later, he started being distant and don’t talk to me as much anymore. I’m assuming he doesn’t need my help anymore and I’m happy for him but I can’t lie if it didn’t hurt my feelings at all? Even though we only knew each other for just over a month.\\n\\nSometimes I just want everything to stop and stop caring so much. But I really do can’t help it. \\n\\nPardon for my english as it’s my second language.', 'So, long story short, I’ve been at the same job as a supervisor for going on six years. I have a Bachelors in psychology, a minor in painting, and months of shadowing experience with ABA therapy; yet, I have no actual clue what I want to do with my life.\\nI’ve done so many career inventories. I’ve talked to all my professors. I’ve resorted to talking to people I meet at my job to see what they do for a living. \\nI feel so stuck and desperate for change. \\nI’m just petrified of picking one path, spending so much money on that one path, and regretting it all.\\nLike I cycle monthly between each potential career fantasy I could have. \\nIn march, I wanted to be a RN or an art professor. In April, I was thinking about law school. Today it’s IO Psych or Psychiatry. I feel insane. I just know i want to help people.\\nHow the heck do you figure out what you want to do?', \"A common skill INFJs employ is to immediately tap into a deep connection during communication. This is done often by deep eye contact, very heightened listening skills, carefully crafted response, and questioning the heart of the subject. \\n\\nHere's the problem. Some don't seem to think an immediate deployment of intuition is a source of reliable connection. People can be very confused, scared, become distrustful, or if they are good at intuition too, they play the wrong mind games back to you. \\n\\nAll in all such misunderstandings are not only unnecessary, but also can lead to costly mistakes. Yet in the INFJs mind, the INFJs are just trying to help humanity. Example: \\n\\n\\\\- You would think a nurse, a judge, and police officer are people who often use intuition to get things done in life. That I found can be the complete opposite. If you use intuition at them it can lead to negative effects. They can be distrustful and ready to punish when you are figuring out an intuitive-based response. There are many reasons, it could be they are very overworked and stressed. They just want you to be a sensor so they can quickly get a sensing job done. It can be that they saw through you and you may be crafting a rebellious response. They can act on the wrong actions based on the wrong impressions of you. A police can give you a much stringent order, a nurse can delay a critical response, a judge can corner you into saying the wrong statements in court.\\n\\n\\\\- When I interact with people very different from me, whether by upbringing, culture, religion, or profession. I just listen intently as I would with anyone else. Yet it seems people think I am stupid or confused at the simplest stuff, while I have already figured out they have a different life, plus exactly why. In other words you can be dumbed down so much even if your mind is way ahead of the conversation. And that can lead to costly outcomes as well (like being underhanded negotiation, workplace interaction, and more) \\n\\nI think turning off intuition is just not possible, because life itself is complicated. For example, I have been a minority all my life; the punishment for not using intuition to get ahold of the situation can be great. There are too many factors that facilitate misunderstanding, and you never know what it is that made people draw very wrong conclusions on you (age, appearance, social status, etc.)\\n\\nThe solution is just to hone social skills more I suppose. What skills do you use to offset misunderstandings so they don't take the wrong actions against you?\", \"As an INFJ (T), I find myself instinctively becoming people's therapists, and always trying to give them the best responses and quality of conversation I can when it comes to their lives. In return I often overshare things thinking that it's safe to do so because they felt comfortable doing that with me. What I find is that the majority of people, ie my girlfriend, father, mother, brother, and closest friends, etc either aren't interested in what is going on in my life or don't have the bandwidth or capacity to help me in the same ways that I help them. They are occasionally mean or rude to me as well in a dominating or disrespectful way, or act like they're playing games, and I feel like they look down on me or think of me as someone who owes them the quality of conversation I impulsively provide. I avoid games and conniving comments because I know how they make people feel, but most people around me seem to do these sorts of things, or they at least act frustrated. Those closest to me also rarely inquire about my life, but instead spend our time together talking about theirs.\", 'My ex broke up with me 10 months ago, and I\\'m still reeling in a world of pain, anger, and sadness. I truly did love her and am finding very difficult to move on and let go. Relationship breakups can be challenging for me since I often feel blindsided and like \"they gave up.\"\\n\\nIs this what make INFJ dumpees go through? Does anyone else experience this?', 'I\\'m an INTJ who questions what Ni is...\\nI know it\\'s Imagination yet, it always seems as if there\\'s something more to Ni...and it makes me think of Voodoo or some other realm which involves Magic or something. I notice a lot of people are Envious of INTJ\\'S &amp; even INFJ\\'S but...who would be so envious of people whose dominant function is Imagination?🤔as in...what is there to envy about people who live in Imagination? I ask INTJ\\'S this but I also post the same question to INFJ\\'S... ...it\\'s odd that those who lead with Ni are so good at everything...which makes it seem like to others that we Ni dominants are Witches or something🤔\\nAgain...there\\'s something more going on with Ni being more than just \"Imagination\" because of what I noticed/experienced &amp; I\\'ve heard other Ni-doms mention Ni Solving things in a matter of Hours within the same day \"magically\"...yet, no other dominant function does such like that.\\nI always question if Voodoo/Witchcraft is involved within/at Ni. INTJ\\'S \"Mastermind Schemes\" take place at Ni. Some would question if Imagination could really do a lot of what Ni does.\\nI\\'ve heard Non-INTJ\\'S &amp; \\nNon-INFJ\\'S say \"Ni is the most Voodoo-y function\".\\nI\\'ve had my good &amp; bad with Ni...&amp; I mentioned my frustrations with it. Ni is the most Mystical function but...why is it called being so mystical if it\\'s just Imagination?! Mystical is when something else is there or under something in which u can\\'t see.\\nI love Witches &amp; Wizards but sometimes I wish the universe or something would tell me what Ni really is...&amp; not just it being Imagination.', \"I have parents who are Intj and entp who are too overprotective and they make me feel suffocated in their rules. Whenever i mess up i always get scolded or worse, grounded. I don't know what else to say but that's the summary of it 😅\", 'Let me know if any of the lessons I’ve learned resonate with you 👍 \\n\\nI spent the last 2.5 years trying to build a coaching business. I learned a lot along the way, but never converted a customer. \\n\\nThe lack of progress drove a lot of anger and anxiety. I just thought I could will myself to success. \\n\\nAll this changed recently. After actually asking for help from people who were in a position to do so, I’ve been developing some relationships that could blossom into some lucrative progress. \\n\\nLesson: actually initiating feedback conversations was painful but worth it. \\n\\nI may begin as a junior partner under a highly accomplished executive coach. I had to accept that it’s so much easier to build something myself after gaining a few years experience with someone already established. Especially in corporate environments. That said, I only recently could show that I have some real expertise in my chosen field. It took 3 years of knowing what work I wanted to do and trying to get there to even afford me this opportunity. \\n\\nLesson: my willpower, though it contributed to unnecessary suffering, was still the core power that led me to this culmination. \\n\\nI want to play things cool; neither getting paranoid nor too hopeful. I just want to be relaxed and open to this positive change. I’ll be hanging out on a houseboat with him and a handful of other people that would be good to make good impressions on. I want to be known and liked. Trust will come with time. \\n\\nLesson: the optimal outcome is mostly likely achieved when relaxed and present-focused', '']\n"

The concept is simple: you simplify your goal to something you can do in two minutes, and do that. The idea is that by doing so, it will be easier to start; it’s comparatively easy to pick up your textbook and read one sentence(on second thought, one sentence may be a bit too much of an oversimplification, even for this oversimplified task) when compared to studying an entire chapter. The idea is to take out your textbook, start reading that one sentence, and from there, continue working on. \\n\\nIf you’re trying to read a book, it’s easy to get lost in the story and read for a solid hour straight. However, what isn’t so easy is getting started and taking out your book. If your mindset is to clear out one whole our of your day to read, that’s intimidating. Instead, by oversimplifying it down to the bare minimum, you can make yourself get started, as since your book is already out and your laptop is already closed, you might as well read instead of mindlessly browsing YouTube until you realise how late it’s gotten(happens to the best of us). As James Clear writes it, “The point is to master the habit of showing up.“ \\n\\nIf you’re in a situation similar to mine where you intend on writing a big project but don’t know where to start, force yourself to look into the topic for a few minutes, and if you feel like it, continue from there. That’s how I shamelessly wrote this month’s appreciation post in the span of one hour when I’ve been telling myself to write this for the past week. If you’re in school, you can make yourself get out your study notes and resources, and continue on from there. If you’re trying to learn an instrument, take it out and play a scale. This concept can be applied in basically every situation where you want to get yourself to do something, and basically works out as a mindset to make yourself achieve the things you’ve said you would before going back to bed and start experiencing a midlife crisis. \\n\\nTo sum up everything in a short paragraph, the two minute rule is where you oversimplify things to the bare minimum to make yourself start working on something, before continuing to plough on. The idea is to make it less intimidating and easier to get into, making you accomplish your goal of getting started easier, and since you’ve started the job you may as well finish it. If you procrastinate, hopefully this will at least be a step in the direction of not, and if you don’t procrastinate, please teach the rest of us the way. \\n\\nFor today’s appreciation day, try to comment something nice that happened to you the past month. Now, if you excuse me, I have a page to read. But just one more episode of anime before that. \\n\\nThank you for reading! \\n\\nSources: [https://jamesclear.com/how-to-stop-procrastinating](https://jamesclear.com/how-to-stop-procrastinating)\\n\\n“*The future depends on what we do in the present.*” -Gandhi',\n",

       "     'selftext': 'Hello, I just want to share here about my struggle, and I will try to keep it as short as I can. So, as the title says, most of my life I have made friends with people who tend to compare and compete with me, and it started with my very first close friendship. These friendships left me hurt and struggling with the feeling of not being loved.\\n\\nThey always tend to comment on my appearance, and it is always about something that I can’t change unless I go under the knife. These comments will always be remembered because of how much they made me feel ugly at some point in my life. Or it would be insults about me as a person, and they would try to make me feel like I’m a horrible person to make themselves feel better about hurting me. I sometimes reach a state of actually believing it and feeling depressed because I always try to be better for the people around me. They try to isolate me from others and get jealous if I’m hanging out with other people. They copy the things I do and wear without complimenting me, only criticizing me for everything, especially if they can’t copy me. They seem to always want me to fail. Why? I feel like I was good to them and fully accepted them, but I don’t think they felt the same. I hate it. I hate taking the step to cut them off, and I hate that I try to be on my best behavior because I thought that it was my fault. That I wasn’t good enough for them. But when I’m out of these friendships, I always realize how much I was good to them and that I wasn’t the horrible person that they made me feel like I was. I’m actually starting to believe that I’m meant to be alone.\\n\\nMy first best friend during the 3 years in middle school:\\nShe would stop talking to me and get mad at me for the whole day because I got better grades than her.\\nShe would tell me to sit with her during lunch breaks and leave me alone.\\nShe told me she didn’t like when I talked to other people other than her.\\nShe made me believe that we were going to be in high school together, then left our school without telling me. (That was soul-crushing for my 13-year-old self.)\\n\\nIn high school, there were too many incidents to mention, so I will jump to college. I had a friend (21F) from school who got accepted to the same university as me. The way she was treating me was so horrible that I had to cut her off. She was getting to the point of obsession. Fast forward to now, another friend (22F) of mine that I really love her company. She’s so fun to be around, but I noticed that she would make some kind of comment like, \"No guy cares that you exist, and no one truly wants you.\" Another comment is that I look like I’m 32 years old, which was very random since I didn’t ask.\\n\\nSo, I really want to know if this is common or if I’m doing something wrong. Am I choosing the wrong friends, and what are the things that are attracting them to me?',\n",

I feel like I was good to them and fully accepted them, but I don’t think they felt the same. I hate it. I hate taking the step to cut them off, and I hate that I try to be on my best behavior because I thought that it was my fault. That I wasn’t good enough for them. But when I’m out of these friendships, I always realize how much I was good to them and that I wasn’t the horrible person that they made me feel like I was. I’m actually starting to believe that I’m meant to be alone.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My first best friend during the 3 years in middle school:\\nShe would stop talking to me and get mad at me for the whole day because I got better grades than her.\\nShe would tell me to sit with her during lunch breaks and leave me alone.\\nShe told me she didn’t like when I talked to other people other than her.\\nShe made me believe that we were going to be in high school together, then left our school without telling me. (That was soul-crushing for my 13-year-old self.)&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;In high school, there were too many incidents to mention, so I will jump to college. I had a friend (21F) from school who got accepted to the same university as me. The way she was treating me was so horrible that I had to cut her off. She was getting to the point of obsession. Fast forward to now, another friend (22F) of mine that I really love her company. She’s so fun to be around, but I noticed that she would make some kind of comment like, &amp;quot;No guy cares that you exist, and no one truly wants you.&amp;quot; Another comment is that I look like I’m 32 years old, which was very random since I didn’t ask.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;So, I really want to know if this is common or if I’m doing something wrong. Am I choosing the wrong friends, and what are the things that are attracting them to me?&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

At certain point of life I had problems in my school and was really depressed and sick too. But still I managed my school life well. I got to change my place. I got  admission in high school in different place. Everything was new but I really can't keep up with my school. I can't manage with new people new place with my overwhelming nature. Getting scared easily , anxious and so on. And yeah I falled my high school and got passed in re-exam . And yeah I give the entrance exam for medical college but I couldn't pass it. And I drop a year. And people around me are really mean they are saying a lot of bad things about me like I am ugly and not good at study, don't know to do anything. And these things are said by a person whom I wasn't expecting. I feel bad I never feel I was enough even though I was good at my study in school. There was always people who had problem with me and I really feel bad for disappointing my parents. I don't wanna think about it but still keep over thinking and feel like my head is gonna brust\",\n",

       "     'selftext': 'Let me start by saying the only people who I’ve felt truly understood me, and that I’ve felt safe around are INFJ’s. It’s not a large list, I’ve known 2-3 in my entire life.\\n\\nThat being said… this feeling of being misunderstood or socially isolated, is not a determining factor of being an INFJ. It can be a symptom of it, especially in younger developing INFJ’s.\\n\\nNi-Fe-Ti-Se is not HYPER emotional and it’s not HYPER introverted. It’s as close to the opposite as the “Introverted” “Feeling” types get.\\n\\nBeing damaged, insecure, socially isolated, and burning bridges are not INFJ’s hallmarks. If you’re trying to relate to MBTI stereotypes just stop. This system isn’t a horoscope. It’s not meant to justify your behavior or relate to feeling alone because every individual can feel this way. It’s a tool for personal growth, and used wrong can be more detrimental than helpful.\\n\\nIf you feel “finally understood” or “you get it now” based off shallow stereotypes fight me.\\n\\nI won’t use the phrases “real/true INFJ” because it’s an insult to those who truly are here to discuss the MBTI and grow. Use the tools for self reflection and self improvement. That’s what they’re here for, not for you to talk about if “other INFJ’s love romance” idk what to tell you.\\n\\nHumans can’t be put into 1/16 boxes this is not what any of this is here for. It’s supposed to be used for personal growth, not to connect to “like minded individuals” because I hate to burst anyone’s bubble, but INFJ’s don’t actually get along well with other INFJ’s. (Generally, not in all cases, if i can throw my own over generalized stereotype in.)\\n\\nSupport systems, friends, and partners come from shared experiences, pain, and triumph. Not by matching MBTI types to justify negative behavior.',\n",

It’s not a large list, I’ve known 2-3 in my entire life.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That being said… this feeling of being misunderstood or socially isolated, is not a determining factor of being an INFJ. It can be a symptom of it, especially in younger developing INFJ’s.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Ni-Fe-Ti-Se is not HYPER emotional and it’s not HYPER introverted. It’s as close to the opposite as the “Introverted” “Feeling” types get.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Being damaged, insecure, socially isolated, and burning bridges are not INFJ’s hallmarks. If you’re trying to relate to MBTI stereotypes just stop. This system isn’t a horoscope. It’s not meant to justify your behavior or relate to feeling alone because every individual can feel this way. It’s a tool for personal growth, and used wrong can be more detrimental than helpful.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;If you feel “finally understood” or “you get it now” based off shallow stereotypes fight me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I won’t use the phrases “real/true INFJ” because it’s an insult to those who truly are here to discuss the MBTI and grow. Use the tools for self reflection and self improvement. That’s what they’re here for, not for you to talk about if “other INFJ’s love romance” idk what to tell you.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Humans can’t be put into 1/16 boxes this is not what any of this is here for. It’s supposed to be used for personal growth, not to connect to “like minded individuals” because I hate to burst anyone’s bubble, but INFJ’s don’t actually get along well with other INFJ’s. (Generally, not in all cases, if i can throw my own over generalized stereotype in.)&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Support systems, friends, and partners come from shared experiences, pain, and triumph. Not by matching MBTI types to justify negative behavior.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

Did he just turn cold on me or was he just not that into me or is he just processing this in a way that I don’t understand?😢&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

I really wanted to use systems that gave me more peace of mind and help me free up time to do my passion projects. When I was younger I really loved productivity youtube because of the promise that I\\'d be able to free up time in our incredibly \" work\" focused society. However now, after I discovered I\\'m an INFJ, Highly Sensitive Person, and Night Owl I really have a hard time taking this productivity advice seriously. First off all, alot of this advice never works for me, and even when it does work it feels like I\\'m fighting with myself to make it work. I think this is because this mainstream advice is often targeted towards most people. And as an INFJ I don\\'t really fall into the most people category. I honestly like to challenge the current status quo in terms of how I use and plan my time. Im honestly alright with having the most strange scheudle, as long as it works with my natural tendencies and helps me feel less overwhelmed. As an INFJ I\\'m perfectionsitic and get anxious easily. As an Highly Sensitive Person (1/5 people are Highly Sensitive) I am incrdibly sensitive and get easily overwhelemed. As a night owl I flourish working at night, and would prefer to sleep in the early morning, and do fun stuff during the afternoon. I just feel like the advice thats often told by everyone is just very contradiciting to the way I function. As an INFJ I am incredibly creative so I\\'v been trying to create my own systems. But this creativity often doesn\\'t have any restrictions so trying to find a solid system is hard.\\n\\nHow do you feel about current productivity advice as an INFJ? What do you do to have a good peace of mind? Do you have any advice for me?\\n\\nThanks for reading :)',\n",

Breaking them down then looking up how to heal from them in a healthy way. A pattern I noticed in my life is being isolated. And it really sucks. \\n\\nWhen i was a kid, my mom moved away from our family because she came out as a lesbian and my family was uber christian. We moved to a competely different state with completely different demographics. (Went from all black south chicago to 96% Caucasian Wisconsin). We moved in with a woman who would go on to mentally, emotionally and physically abuse me (which made me go into a shell) and I watched as she did the same to my mom. But us being us, I took on my moms trauma because thats what I thought I was suppose to do. This made me go into my shell more. Also, my moms gf had a daughter who got all of the attention and good stuff (I slept on a cot for some years then a futon). More going into my shell. Jump to after they break up, im an only child with a young single mom. I didnt see her because she had to work then wanted to go out on the weekends. We moved a LOT, and always to small towns, so i never really made any friends. Jump over a lot of stuff and highschool comes. My moms dating another woman. Shes mentally abusive. She wants my mom to herself so they do stuff without me. I barely had food to eat. Isolated again. I had friends in school but theres nothing more lonely then feeling alone around others. After that relationship, my mom got an apartment but stopped coming home. For 3 years. She would stop by to drop off some oven pizzas, bread and pop tarts. Thats all I ate for 3 years. And that was when I felt the most alone. Jump over some things. I move back to chicago and become a Jehovahs Witness but I never get invited out to anything. In fact, the ideas I had for gatherings, they used but took other people. Now Im not a witness so I have no spiritual family, ive got no friends, I live in LA now and I realize idk how to make friends and Im worried these years of isolation have messed up my head. Now Im 30 and trying to learn how to be \"social\". \\n\\n\\nIf someone took the time to read that, I appreciate you and we are friends now 😄. Im just venting so I dont get an anxiety attack haha. I posted it here because learning that Im an INFJ helped me a lot with my past and couldnt think of better people to vent to.',\n",

All of it..is that from his mind. His brain...his heart. Or his soul?\\n\\nGeorge went 'mad' and couldn't even recognize his own love, Charlotte. Does that mean he doesn't exist. He does cause he is alive but what makes him HIM. If his mind, heart and body isn't enough or is too limiting to hold his own self than is he just trapped in his cage (his own mind and body). But the he i am talking about. Is it the soul then? Is the soul only thing that remains. The only thing that can withstand change but doesn't lose itself . Am I making sense?  And the fact that no matter how close you are with another person..you always come first. Like you can't love another being without existing in the first place.\\n\\nAnd whatever love is..it is most divine\",\n",

       "     'selftext': 'So my best friend is an INFJ guy. He\\'s been through a lot in his life and is currently dealing with a lot as well. He also has mental health issues. It\\'s the same with me too so that\\'s why we\\'ve bonded over similar experiences and stuff.\\n\\nLately, he\\'s been acting strange. I\\'ve always been there for him and I\\'ve been wanting to help him solve his problems but he\\'s kinda pushing me away and doesn\\'t want to take my help. Which I completely understand and respect, so I stopped doing that. \\n\\nHe\\'s still been complaining to me about his problems and Idk what to do, so I\\'m just being there for him. \\n\\n\\nHe\\'s now accusing me, saying that I\\'m not really there for him when he needs me. He says he doesn\\'t want me to solve his problems, but he just wants me to console him and support him emotionally/mentally. Which I\\'m already doing by the way. \\n\\nWhat really pissed me off is when he started getting mad at me for no reason and saying hurtful things to me. Like, the other day he wasn\\'t in a good frame of mind and he said to me \"I\\'m suspicious, I wonder why do you want to help me so much? It\\'s probably because you want me to be your boyfriend\" \\n\\nThat really hurt me. He thinks I want to help him because I want something from him in return or I want to win his heart so that he\\'ll be my boyfriend. It\\'s not true. I just want to help him because I care for him as a friend.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe was having a mental breakdown yesterday and when that happens, he tends to lash out. He said he was feeling horrible and suicidal as well. At that time, I was a bit busy and couldn\\'t be there for him so I just sent him hugs. He got mad and started accusing me more and saying that his intuition is right, that I only wanted to help him because I wanted something, and now that I\\'m not getting it, I don\\'t care about him. And also how I\\'m a horrible person because I couldn\\'t be there for him when he was feeling suicidal, even though he knew I was busy.\\n\\nI\\'m just really hurt and I don\\'t know what to do. Yes, I did have romantic feelings for this guy in the past, but that\\'s not why I wanna help him. I want to help because I really care for him and don\\'t wanna see him suffer. I have nothing to gain. And also, just because I wasn\\'t there for him when he was feeling suicidal, doesn\\'t make me a bad person. I was really busy at that time, and couldn\\'t be there for him. Also, I had no idea how to help him at that time.\\n\\nHe continued saying rude things, I got mad at him and we had a fight. We aren\\'t talking to each other at the moment.\\n\\nI\\'m not offended by his words. I know he was having a mental breakdown at that time because of some stuff that happened with him so he was taking out his anger on me. I\\'m just hurt and sad about what happened and the way he thinks about me.\\n\\nOtherwise, he\\'s an amazing guy. Very sweet, compassionate and down to earth. It\\'s just when he has a breakdown, his insecurities get the best of him and he becomes into another person. Angry, rude, paranoid, suspicious, etc... \\n\\nWhat do I do? Are INFJs like this? Is it an INFJ thing to not accept help? I heard insecurity is common in this type though. Idk how true is that. \\n\\nUh I\\'m just sad and wanted to vent I guess....',\n",

When he found out that I knew, he cut off all contact with me. Two months later, he and his girlfriend broke up. I have to admit that before he was single, I'd look at his TikToks a lot. I never liked or commented on it; I'd just watch the videos.\\n\\nA few days before he and his girlfriend broke up, I noticed that my TikToks would go up. I had 3 followers, but whenever I'd watch his videos, a few hours later, my TikTok views would rise. I even tried doing it on certain days; eg. I'd watch his videos one day, watch it two days later, then the day after, and each time I saw them, my views went up, and on the days that I didn't watch them, they stayed the same. This continued for the better part of a year. Last year, it was still frequent, but less so. Now, it's every two or three weeks that we do this. One time, he even posted a TikTok in English (English isn't his first language, and all of his previous videos were in his native language).\\n\\nTikTok wasn't the only platform he was looking at me on. He would do it on Twitter too. One time, I retweeted a picture of a Star Wars character. Less than an hour later, he posted a meme of that same character. The meme was in English, and it's not that I want to say that the meme wasn't funny, but it was obvious that he posted it just to post it. There's been at least three other instances where he did something similar.\\n\\nHowever, twice he did things that tickled me funny. About six months after they broke up, he started following her on TikTok, but unfollowed her within a few hours (probably because she didn’t follow him back). A month later, one of his ex's close friends posted a TikTok video with his ex in it. He started following this friend. Around eight months of this going on, he made his Instagram and TikTok private. I have no idea why. But I can tell he still looks at my TikTok, because TikTok tells who looks at your profile. I don’t post much, and he looks at it every two to three days.\",\n",

       "     'selftext': 'My girlfriend and I have been dating 4 years and we went long distance about 8 months ago. I’m a senior in highschool and she’s a junior. Lately I’ve been struggling with overthinking a lot. It’s fucking with a lot of aspects of our connection. I’m not always vocalizing these thoughts because I now they are farfetched and just my anxiety. For example however I’ve been overthinking our conversations a lot and what used to be a perfect conversational flow has become very hit or miss. If I’m lucky and say the right things our conversation falls into a flow but if not they feel choppy and forced. Another example, I visited her this past week we were intimate 4 times and I got performance anxiety twice when she asked me to take a shower something about the standing up made me overthink my erection as opposed to just foreplay in bed. To be honest I think this happenes because she just feels so far out of my league. She’s the most likeable person in every aspect. She’s kind, extremely attractive like a super model, and it feels like everyone she talks to is drawn to her presence. We plan to go to USF together after I finish 2 years of community college and she will be there a year without me. I can’t help but worry that if I keep this up she’s going to dump me that first year. We’ve been planning our lives together for years and that would crush me I geniunely wouldn’t want anyone else she brings so much structure and stability to my life. Any advice regarding what I can do to stop overthinking our relationship, what you guys find attractive about intps, ways to improve our conversations, or anything else would be appreciated',\n",

I\\'m sharing a link to a giveaway bundle of free gifts from women running heart-centered businesses online.\\n\\nI know NFs can be sensitive, growth-oriented, heart-centered people, so it may interest you to grab this giveaway which includes mindfulness, creativity, healing, spirituality, business, and life resources.\\n\\nIf you identify as highly sensitive and easily overstimulated, you\\'ll also find my course there for free on solving overstimulation from a subconscious-functioning perspective.\\n\\nIt\\'s open this week only, for 4 more days.\\n\\n[You can grab it here!](https://www.creativeubusiness.com/eb23-giveaway)',\n",

Once upon a time, another username ago, &lt;a href=\"/r/INFJ\"&gt;r/INFJ&lt;/a&gt; was my main stomping ground! It was truly so good for my development as a person to hang out with other INFJs and just be instantly understood. I&amp;#39;m just realizing how all this contact with INFJ world, plus 14 years with my ENFP partner, (and also being selective with the people in my life in general) has eliminated so much of that &amp;quot;too misunderstood&amp;quot; angst from my life.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I have no idea if this will be allowed here or removed for being promotional, so I&amp;#39;ll keep it brief. I&amp;#39;m sharing a link to a giveaway bundle of free gifts from women running heart-centered businesses online.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I know NFs can be sensitive, growth-oriented, heart-centered people, so it may interest you to grab this giveaway which includes mindfulness, creativity, healing, spirituality, business, and life resources.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;If you identify as highly sensitive and easily overstimulated, you&amp;#39;ll also find my course there for free on solving overstimulation from a subconscious-functioning perspective.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s open this week only, for 4 more days.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.creativeubusiness.com/eb23-giveaway\"&gt;You can grab it here!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

Honestly, I was kind of hurt because I liked him, but he thought I was dating someone else (which I wasn\\'t), and he started going out with his sister\\'s friend. It\\'s clear that they got set up. But I saw them doing all these things together; going to get ramen, rock climbing, to the pumpkin patch.

       "     'selftext': \" With all due respect to the diversity present in the domain, I was curious to know that Is the demisexuality I experience in my case, is it common with a lot of us INFJs. You know , I had a relatively tough time understanding my sexuality. Like physical beauty might not be the very aspect turning me on. Infact I used to feel out when friends of mine would be passing comments on the physical features of the other person /gender. There was a time when I did feelif something is wrong with me, until I met a someone with whom I was fortunate enough to eshtablish a deep transcendental emotional intimacy. Then what I discovered in myself was amazing and kinda liberating. For me, inclusive of all the kinks and fantasies (aren't they same lol) sex is indeed a very sacred and beautiful experience. A person being comfortable and trusting the other person such enough so that they can lay open to them, exposing their scars, boundaries, body , fantasies, to explore a new sensation. Without an emotional sync, wouldn't it be - bland? Well who am I to question the other possibilities. I respect everyone's preferences but yes this is me and I was seeing a post here and felt that a lot of INFJs are demisexual.\\n\\nWell, theoretically , the concept of pan sexuality does make a lot of sense to me, because I feel that love and attraction don't need to be bounded by gender, but off lately , I have realised that I am indeed a hetero demi sexual man indeed. Like theoretically I might like to flirt with anyone but don't know if I want it in real. I don't know why I guess I was trying to fit a definition earlier and not understand that it's rather the inner calling!\\n\\nI would love to hear insights !\",\n",

You know , I had a relatively tough time understanding my sexuality. Like physical beauty might not be the very aspect turning me on. Infact I used to feel out when friends of mine would be passing comments on the physical features of the other person /gender. There was a time when I did feelif something is wrong with me, until I met a someone with whom I was fortunate enough to eshtablish a deep transcendental emotional intimacy. Then what I discovered in myself was amazing and kinda liberating. For me, inclusive of all the kinks and fantasies (aren&amp;#39;t they same lol) sex is indeed a very sacred and beautiful experience. A person being comfortable and trusting the other person such enough so that they can lay open to them, exposing their scars, boundaries, body , fantasies, to explore a new sensation. Without an emotional sync, wouldn&amp;#39;t it be - bland? Well who am I to question the other possibilities. I respect everyone&amp;#39;s preferences but yes this is me and I was seeing a post here and felt that a lot of INFJs are demisexual.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Well, theoretically , the concept of pan sexuality does make a lot of sense to me, because I feel that love and attraction don&amp;#39;t need to be bounded by gender, but off lately , I have realised that I am indeed a hetero demi sexual man indeed. Like theoretically I might like to flirt with anyone but don&amp;#39;t know if I want it in real. I don&amp;#39;t know why I guess I was trying to fit a definition earlier and not understand that it&amp;#39;s rather the inner calling!&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I would love to hear insights !&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

Maybe it could be a to each their own thing or just a &amp;quot;me, weirdo, yup I&amp;#39;m &amp;quot;that&amp;quot; INFJ&amp;quot;, but I&amp;#39;ve also come to the point where I know what I want, the &amp;quot;all or nothing&amp;quot; ordeal, I can&amp;#39;t stop &amp;quot;half way&amp;quot; if I&amp;#39;m wanting to be real, my honest self, and not hold back any of my love, and yes, I don&amp;#39;t want to &amp;quot;marry my therapist&amp;quot;, but, I can&amp;#39;t have be so deep and vulnerable with someone/a therapist and need to be more cut and dry as patient, appointment, sessions, 1 hour to &amp;quot;vent&amp;quot; vs naturally connecting with someone, both of us accepting and being vulnerable with each other, and having the same/similar goals and values in mind, while helping the other to heal and grow (as a person).&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Hope all or some of this made sense if you read this far.

Meaning the arguments she provided were honest and I wasn’t at ease with living the way I lived.\\n\\nDuring 5 months we were platonic but kept in touch as well as seeing each other twice a week. She then decided to 6 months abroad to work.\\nThe last month we rekindled and it seemed we were back together (she talked about having kids marriage and stuff to me and to her mother as well (the only other human being really knowing her), telling she loved me etc\\n\\nNow it’s been a month there she  told me I misunderstood and we weren’t together. That she has no need to tell me what she’s up to because she won’t ever let someone take away her freedom again \\nShe is angry that during our first two years together she had to stay in our country instead of us going in the world ( we spent 1-2 months abroad + she left alone the country for a total of 2 months per year.\\n\\nI felt guilty until she and her mother seemed to see my improvements . \\nHer mother says that she’ll regret it one day because she knows now that I deeply loved her daughter to the core, that I was the only one who could improve her mood and because she told her she loved me … a month ago.\\n\\nNow she completely changed her mind and after all this story I feel like .. manipulated ?\\nI feel this isn’t done on purpose and just an extension of some deeper problems/immaturity and that i can’t do anything beside cutting ties now. I will love her from afar and in sadness but I don’t feel like I can do anything more..\\n\\nSo … am I wrong ? Do I miss something ?  I’ve lost all sleep because my brain keeps seeking logic in all of this even tho I can’t find any',\n",

Meaning the arguments she provided were honest and I wasn’t at ease with living the way I lived.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;During 5 months we were platonic but kept in touch as well as seeing each other twice a week. She then decided to 6 months abroad to work.\\nThe last month we rekindled and it seemed we were back together (she talked about having kids marriage and stuff to me and to her mother as well (the only other human being really knowing her), telling she loved me etc&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Now it’s been a month there she  told me I misunderstood and we weren’t together. That she has no need to tell me what she’s up to because she won’t ever let someone take away her freedom again \\nShe is angry that during our first two years together she had to stay in our country instead of us going in the world ( we spent 1-2 months abroad + she left alone the country for a total of 2 months per year.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I felt guilty until she and her mother seemed to see my improvements . \\nHer mother says that she’ll regret it one day because she knows now that I deeply loved her daughter to the core, that I was the only one who could improve her mood and because she told her she loved me … a month ago.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Now she completely changed her mind and after all this story I feel like .. manipulated ?\\nI feel this isn’t done on purpose and just an extension of some deeper problems/immaturity and that i can’t do anything beside cutting ties now. I will love her from afar and in sadness but I don’t feel like I can do anything more..&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;So … am I wrong ? Do I miss something ?  I’ve lost all sleep because my brain keeps seeking logic in all of this even tho I can’t find any&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "     'selftext': 'edit: too sensitive\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\nI posted something recently from an extremist perspective bc in was in the muck of a conflict with my close friend. But here\\'s the thing: I don\\'t like arguing, fighting and pulling each other down even when things get rough. I am usually the type of person to go quiet and process first. I learnt it after years of working on myself and also, surprise, trauma ridden childhood.\\n\\nIt is hard for me to be blaming and lashing on friends, then resolving it all bc \"all relationships have fights\". I have learnt that some of this is inevitable and might even be needed. But, my body\\'s response to be placed in a position of defending myself against someone I love bc they are blaming me unjustly, standing up for myself feels like so much burden and hurtful. When there are scenarios where it is clear cut my fault, I do understand and don\\'t really have ego problems related to acceptance.\\n\\nWhen I\\'m by myself, all I think about is why can\\'t we just trust each other and get along instead of fighting? Instead of blaming, defending and proving like a fucking law firm.\\n\\nI have a LOT of acquaintances, lot of good friends and very few great friends with lot of redeeming qualities (I am also an ENFJ btw but was INFJ for the longest time). But when they lash out because of their personal things, my first response is explaining myself and then tearing up. Because my heart is like \"not again dude, I finally let you in and you clearly have power to make me feel this way!\". I don\\'t know if I should just let things slide and let it be once things have been resolved. My heart clamps up and then it takes time to open up again..  I feel like a child who just wants to be in nice, loving friendships where when conflicts happen we just quietly and lovingly process instead of lashing out. I hate seeing that side of people, their faces and expressions all of it just makes me feel uneasy. Maybe this is all just overthinking or me being to sensitive..',\n",

But here&amp;#39;s the thing: I don&amp;#39;t like arguing, fighting and pulling each other down even when things get rough. I am usually the type of person to go quiet and process first. I learnt it after years of working on myself and also, surprise, trauma ridden childhood.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It is hard for me to be blaming and lashing on friends, then resolving it all bc &amp;quot;all relationships have fights&amp;quot;. I have learnt that some of this is inevitable and might even be needed. But, my body&amp;#39;s response to be placed in a position of defending myself against someone I love bc they are blaming me unjustly, standing up for myself feels like so much burden and hurtful. When there are scenarios where it is clear cut my fault, I do understand and don&amp;#39;t really have ego problems related to acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;When I&amp;#39;m by myself, all I think about is why can&amp;#39;t we just trust each other and get along instead of fighting? Instead of blaming, defending and proving like a fucking law firm.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I have a LOT of acquaintances, lot of good friends and very few great friends with lot of redeeming qualities (I am also an ENFJ btw but was INFJ for the longest time). But when they lash out because of their personal things, my first response is explaining myself and then tearing up. Because my heart is like &amp;quot;not again dude, I finally let you in and you clearly have power to make me feel this way!&amp;quot;. I don&amp;#39;t know if I should just let things slide and let it be once things have been resolved. My heart clamps up and then it takes time to open up again..  I feel like a child who just wants to be in nice, loving friendships where when conflicts happen we just quietly and lovingly process instead of lashing out. I hate seeing that side of people, their faces and expressions all of it just makes me feel uneasy. Maybe this is all just overthinking or me being to sensitive..&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "'my one criticism is your texting habits. Ranges from highly chaotic to \"did they die?\" I hate texting too so I get it but damn.Based on 4 sides of the mind, unhealthy loops/grips when in INFJ unconscious (depression) and/or ISTJ subconscious (anxiety).I was thinking about this time when I was dating this girl. She was amazing in every kind of way, and she really liked me too. We had started seeing each other on the months of October. Her birthday was on mid November.\\n\\nNow mind you she was my first ever date. I didn’t really know how to treat a woman, right. So naturally, I asked her what she wanted for her birthday. And like any sane person during third date, she said it’s OK I don’t want anything. And I took that literally. \\n\\nMy birthdays are not so significant. Since I was a little kid only had like two birthday celebrations. Other years I just be like oh it’s my birthday, I am this years old now. So I thought she didn’t really care about her birthday either. I used to think nobody cared about their birthdays. So I didn’t give her anything. I had tried texting her, but she was cold. I could feel it. But at the time I had no idea why. \\n\\nI thought she had started seeing another person. She had told me about an old friend she met. And from my experience the old friend is always better in some ways than me. And couple weeks later I broke up with her. \\n\\nNow, all of a sudden I’m watching the Orville (it’s a show on Hulu) and there’s this one episode about a characters birthday. And then I realized I could have taken her to dinner, gotten her some cakes and a present for her birthday. Money was not a problem. Now I realize she thought I didn’t like her enough. \\n\\nOh and it took me 2 years to realize this. \\n\\nJust another session of i guess you live and learn with “it is what it is” on top.I know we have Ne-Te loops, and we have an Si grip, and some people say we can have Fi-Si loops, but do we ever get stuck in Fi? It seems like maybe I do sometimes; like as in stubbornly sticking by how I feel (or what I feel to be right) when I make decisions.Lately I\\'ve gotten some signs that meditation might be good for me.\\n\\nI\\'ve tried an app years ago, but didnt really understood what meditation was. It was more of a fun hype.\\n\\nNow that I know better, I\\'m wondering how meditating on a regular basis will go with my ENFP personality. \\n\\nHow is/was that for you?\\n\\nF.e.: I always tend to go full in and completely loose myself in the thing I\\'m doing. And am therefore maybe a bit worried I\\'ll lose my impulsive and spontaneous self (and I even want to be more spontaneous actually, but that\\'s another story).I\\'m wondering how the commonly heard words \"Fi values\" can be transformed into a real part of personality, and can they be weaker(and how) than NFP type descriptions say!I had thought about hiring him as a life coach for a while. I finely took the plunge. He’s a life coach for enfps. It was a good chunk of money for one session a month. Ultimately he didn’t seem like he wanted be there and didn’t care about me at all. The things he said are things I feel like I could have google searched. And it’s on an automatic payment plan that you can get off unless you ask him. It just feels scammy to me and I felt like I wasted my hard earned money. An automatic payment just went through and I asked him to cancel the session and for a refund. I’ll give you an update if he actually refunds the money which he should according to his return policy. I’ll give an update in a few days. If you are looking for a life coach I really think you should think a long time before choosing this one.Ok I’m not complaining, because I love having friends and I love hearing the tea. \\n\\nBut between work and friends from college I get to hear A LOT of tea throughout my week. Plus I have a full time job and I’m trying to focus on many different aspects of my life rn. \\n\\nI’m a good listener but honestly I may not remember something you messaged me on Instagram 3 months ago or a detail from a story you shared awhile ago. \\n\\nI have a friend who will be like re sharing details of a story and I’ll be like “what that’s crazy” and he’s like “no I told you that a while ago!”\\n\\nDoes this happen to anyone else? Sometimes I feel bad, like I’m not a good friend for not remembering everything my friends tell meMine would be \"enfp : how to survive in the world of judgers and sensors\"yea... im a cap and im enfp (i found it out today) \\n\\nive seen tiktoks an vids abt cap always introverted people and pure logical thinkers\\n\\nI have pisces moon and pisces placements in my chart \\n\\nbtw pisces is a enfp (maybe that..)Ughhh. Once again I apologize to ENFPs for being annoying. I am similar to the ENFP stereotype sometimes 😂\\n\\nI often find myself having many different opinions, but a clear opinion. I see so many sides and usually come up with a personalized opinion. This happens very fast in my head and when I end up wording my opinion I look like I’m flip flopping or it’s hard to figure out what side I’m defending. This bothers me bc I want to have integrity and believe I do! I hate when my words don’t match up to what I’m trying to portray, because it took me a lot of time to get this opinion anyways! I think the pressure of it all messes up my wording too 😂\\n\\nI feel like people see me as fake when that’s the last thing I’m trying to do and want to be real! It’s hard being brave enough to confront both sides. Even if I see both sides, I pick a clear side. \\n\\nEdit: I wouldn’t even speak if I didn’t decide I had an opinion. I’m not speaking to speak, it took a long time bc “collected experiences due to intuition” so it’s hard to word myself \\n\\nAny tips? For in the moment, I understand I should take my time\\n\\nEdit: after reading the comments I think extroverted intuition messes with my judgment lol which causes communication issues, who knows lolDo you think this gets in the way of authenticity, or do you view it as an extension of yourself ?I have seen this common topic on MBTI reddits and I would like to ask my own question of you big brained and big hearted beauties, (hope that is taken as the compliment it is meant as lol).\\n\\nBut seriously I am curious if you were single what you would look for in a man and how do you feel about me and my kind, that is INFJs. So you and me, ENFP (F) + INFJ (M) = ?\\n\\nTell me what kind of man would interest you if the man was INFJ, tell me everything I don\\'t know because my interest in the relationship concept is peaked.\\n\\nWould you take an INFJ Man as your life partner, and under what terms?\\n\\nThe floor is yours ladies scare me ... or excite me the choice is yours :)I am happy alone. But around people I constantly struggle with feeling connection-hungry, lonely, or having to hide my authentic self. Empathy, curiosity, humor, being vulnerable have given me relieving connections here and there but they\\'re temporal, to my sad realization; in the long run being with people still consistently feels painful. \\n\\nYou guys are marvelous with people. I don\\'t think enfp skills are that applicable to infps but we share a lot of similarities so i thought why not ask the experts for some advice. \\n\\nLove,\\nYour infp cousinJust wondering, how were your friendships, relationships, etc.. with INTPs. Your favorite and least favorite part of them? Things you believe the INTP could improve on? Then specificly for relationships, if you did happen to date an INTP, what was something that they  did a good job at within the relationship and something that you needed that they lacked or couldn\\'t provide?Have you ever felt this level of anxiety when the people you love, or, in a relationship when the SO doesn\\'t answer back within 24 hours?\\n\\nI mean i do understand they are busy, but 24 hours?? i mean it\\'s not like they didn\\'t use their phone at all for 24 hours\\n\\nTheir reason being that they just are really bad texters but we don\\'t get to meet much due to long distance and everything, but idk, both of us despite trying are not able to reach a middle ground where we are both okay with our preferred form of communication. \\n\\nThey just want me to not overthink about the late replies coz that is how they text, and i can\\'t stop thinking about it. We\\'ve had a lot of fights about it, and i feel i am wrong to expect them to send a fast reply but idkI have never been good at writing (doesn\\'t flow smoothly), so I apologize in advance. You will notice that my writing becomes very unorganized starting midway through the summary because I felt tired typing all of this and reminding myself of bad memories\\n\\nI met an enfp on interpals in 2017. She lives in Korea I live in Canada. She was learning English at the time and I remember on the first day we called, I could not understand her very well. And so, I would be patient and help her with her English everyday through voice calls. I really liked her and she liked me back. Conversations between us would be kind of back and forth, with me mostly asking questions since I struggle to make interesting statements. Later I found out she is actually stuck at home everyday (she was 23 at the time) since she graduated from university because she had to take care of her little stepbrothers. She still is to this day but she is teaching korean online on preply to people around the world (this is important later on). Her mom (divorced) had children with a man, who now does not take any responsiblity for them and comes home at midnight drunk every single day. Her mom has to work so it\\'s up to her to stay home and take care of the children. So you can see that she did not have a good social life. She was also very very naive about men. She loves to meet people and interpals was her way of doing so. She would tell me what these guys texted her and I would say that they are 100% flirting (because they are) and are saying they will come to Korea to meet you because they want to date you. She did not believe me and ALWAYS got annoyed when I told her this. So this made me worried because of how easily she trusts others. She always assumes the best of someone and in the back of my mind, I had a feeling eventually there is going to be a guy she meets online that she will like, and maybe she will leave me for him.\\n\\nI travelled to korea to meet her on April 2018. I was still a student at the time so I didn\\'t have much money. It was a really good time, I met her mom family and I could feel she liked me a lot even though I was quiet and was just being myself. After I came back, she agreed to start a long-distance relationship. We would continue talking, but since we know each other quite well, there wasn\\'t much I could ask anymore. I would result to asking basic, repetitive, \"normal\" questions such as questions about things that are happening in her life in the present. I really have nothing interesting to say, and this is my greatest weakness. I usaully just ask questions like what she\\'s doing today and if she had dinner etc, which I assume she eventually got bored of.\\n\\nEverything was fine, she knew I was a boring person but I knew she was getting a little (maybe 10%) bored. We kept talking and I think in late 2019 she told me she wanted to come visit me and since I was a student and couldn\\'t afford anything and I had such a busy schedule, I had to say no and I told her those reasons. She took that badly, and I could understand why, as we haven\\'t met for so long, so she decided to breakup, however we continued to talk as if nothing happened. We still acted like we were dating although we weren\\'t \"officially\". She would continue to say she loves me but also wanted to be free, free to meet other guys and doesn\\'t want to be controlled (by me).\\n\\nIn 2020, she met an entp on interpals, and as you can guess they both bonded through their Ne and liked each other and he pretty much convinced her to travel to the US to meet him. Despite knowing her financial situation and that she has been stuck at home, he asked HER to go to him. She even told me to leave as she wants to start a new relationship, with the entp after knowing him for a few months .She said she likes him and she loves me as well, but she decided to start a relationship with him, probably because she wanted something new. (I know, it\\'s crazy) I still love her very much and I didn\\'t want to lose her. I am 100% sure she felt so comfortable and relaxed when she was with me and nobody else gave her this feeling. I felt depressed but I continued to talk to her everyday. I noticed she was replying less often and I knew it was because she was talking to him instead. She said breakups will feel bad but time will heal, and that she will distance herself from me slowly and not immediately so that I have time to adjust. Hearing this did not make me feel any better. Eventually she had to block me because I continued to message her. It was very hard for me, I would stay in my room all day doing nothing (also doing that right now after what happened recently). After a few days, she unblocked me and told me she decided that I was more important than the entp and she didn\\'t want to lose me.\\n\\nEverything was ok for a while, we still weren\\'t in a relationship because she always wants to be \"free\" but we still talked and acted like we were. I was fine with that because 1. I don\\'t want to force her to do something she doesn\\'t like 2. It\\'s just a label. I forgot to mention that we basically never had arguments, and the only times we did was when I mentioned that a guy she met online is flirting with her, but she wouldn\\'t accept it. Her excuse would be she doesn\\'t care because she only seems them as friends. (I know, this is bad). Some guys would even say \"Let\\'s travel together! We can stay in the same hotel room but we will sleep in different beds\" . I would tell her that these guys don\\'t see you as friends just because you see them as friends, but she never accepted it. She sees everyone as friends. She also said if she finds someone \"better\" she will be with that guy. She said I can leave whenever I want but I continued to stay and talk to her everyday. Of course I didn\\'t like that but I had to accept it to because I didn\\'t want to lose her (I know, I\\'m crazy).\\n\\nAs she continued her online teaching, I was worried as I knew she would give almost anyone her contact because she sees them as friends. In early 2022, a guy from her university messaged her and they hung out for 2 months. He evnetually asked her to be in a relationship. Initially she rejected, but she accepted after a month or so. I felt disgusting. So disgusitng. I\\'m watching the person I love being taken away by another guy. I know it was my fault for staying. But I knew she still liked me. Maybe she was just looking for something new. I know it;s all so confusing. For a few months she would say she loves me, then for a while she will say she doesn\\'t, She also said I was a boring person.\\n\\nIt\\'s now mid 2022 and I have a job now so I said I will buy her a ticket to come visit me in Canada and also pay for evyerhting else. I knew she likes travelling and hasn\\'t been able to for many years so I booked hotels and made reservations. She ended the relationship with that guy before she came. She said she doesn;t feel like he likes her that much. I told her to look at what other guys have done for her compared to me. I was patient and helped her with her English every since 2017, I helped her with cover letters, resumes, I did evyerhing I could for her and asked nothing in return. I would send gifts occasionally. I even knitted a scarf for her and made unique handwritten letters And now, the first thing I do after getting a job is s[ending a ton of money for her. What have other guys done? Why does she give them a chance at dating her but she won\\'t date me when she clearly says she loves me? It makes no sense. So she came to visit for 2 weeks and left in October. We had a good time but we were still not \"official\". Every month I would send her 700$ to pay for her mom\\'s debt (long story short: her mom used her name and her blood-related sbilings (mid twenties) names to borrow large amounts of money). She was still teaching online and didn\\'t have enough to pay her mom\\'s debt + stuff for her little stepbrothers every month. She has 0$ in savings. When she came back to Korea, she hinted at starting a relationship with me again next year.\\n\\nIn 2023, I found out she has been meeting this guy almost every week for dinner etc. She says she only sees him as a friend but he asked her to be his girlfriend probably like 10 times already. Of course, I tell her that he doesn\\'t see you as a friend. And of course, she says she doesn\\'t care because she only likes him as a friend (she\\'s not lying). And there we had another argument. I said I don\\'t feel good when she\\'s meeting guys who clearly want to date her. She says I\\'m not her boyfriend and she wants to be free. This has been her excuse every argument. So her online teaching continues and recently she told me she does not love me anymore and that she only sees me as a friend. She says she has interest in this other guy (I found out it\\'s one of her students, who has a good job at google and is a few years older than her. She says they have more things to talk about, and I assume it\\'s the honeymoon phase. I know that she always thinks the grass is greener on the other side. I found out because he sent her $1000 usd to her paypal to pay for her vietnam trip with her girlfriends) and she even asked him if he likes her. She says they have an emotional connection with him but she does not with me anymore. So they both like each other and she wants to start dating him. She said I\\'m not attractive to her and I\\'m boring. She says that is her \"type\" and looks like a man, whatever that means. hearing this gave me flashbacks to how I felt when she did this to me previously with the other 2 guys. I have no idea how I will resolve this. She said many times very thankful for all the money I gave and spent for her, she promised to pay me back but I always tell her not to. I doubt she will because it\\'s a lot of money. In total, I probably spent $40,000 on her, giving her money to buy trips to travel because I know she has always been wanting to, booking hotels, getting her a new laptop, getting her hair done etc. I did all of this for her the first thing after getting a job. When she told me this Ive already booked a ticket to korea to meet her (just came back in april).\\n\\nWhile I was in Korea she would remind me almost everyday that she doesn\\'t love me anymore and that we are only friends because she wants to be with that guy, but I could tell from her actions that she still liked me and felt very comfortable and relaxed with me. At this point, I think she has gotten too comfortable with me where she knows she can do whatever she wants and I will accept it because I don\\'t want to lose her. I think that guy will visit Korea this month to meet her. She has been ignoring my texts for a long time so I think this might really be the end. I am stuck in a rut and have been sulking in my room everyday after work. This is probably the worst feeling I have felt in my lifetime\\n\\nSummary of the summary\\n\\n* I met the enfp online, we liked each other\\n\\n* I sent her handmade gifts, knitted a scarf, wrote letters, etc few times per year\\n\\n* She was naive many things, especially men, because she could not have a normal social life in her 20s\\n\\n* She wouldnt listen to me when I warn her to not trust people so easily and to not assume the best of everyone because of the second bullet point\\n\\n* She loves meeting people and sees everyone as friends\\n\\n* Eventually she met an ENTP and they both liked each other, she told me to leave so she could be with him. After blocking me for a while she regrets. We are not in a relationship but we talk like we are\\n\\n* She got tired of waiting for me to meet her, wants to have the freedom to meet other guys\\ndated a guy from her univeristy for 2 months, ended when she thought he wasn\\'t very interested in him\\n2022 may, I got a job offer, first things i do is buy her a ticket to come visit, hotels, places to visit, a better laptop for her to teach her lessons, gave her $700 every month to pay off her mom\\'s debt. When I came to korea in april 2023, I bought us a trip to other countries, bought her clothes and so many things with the money I saved up. Who has donethis for her? Nobody\\n\\n* 2023 - present, she says she doesnt love me anymore because she\\'s interested in another guy (a student proably) that shes been teaching for a few months. says he\\'s attractive to her (appearance and mental) and says she only sees me as a friend now but is thankful for all i did for her\\n\\n* I think she has been acting more rude to me because she knows I will just accept it\\n\\n* That guy she likes is coming to visit in May. this month will be hell for me I stayed loyal, did everything I could for her, spent hours everyday helping her improve her english since 2017, was kind (maybe too kind because she became too comfortable with me), spent large amounts of money for her because I don\\'t know any other way to show that she\\'s important to me. I believe spending a lot of money on her to be happy = many hours worked = lots of effort. What has any other guy done for her? She is leaving me for a guy she met for a few months. Does she not rememeber all I\\'ve done for her? She says she has lost interest in me now and formed an emotional connection with the guy. I don\\'t know what to do, I don\\'t want to lose her. I am losing a lot of sleep from this. I probably missed a lot of details in the summary and probably didn\\'t say everything I wanted to say. I know it is completely my fault for not leaving but the thing is I really don\\'t want to lose her. I feel like she doesn\\'t understand how much effort I put to be with her. I care about her health and everything about her. I never asked anything in return\\n\\nShe has been replying a lot less often and I assume she\\'s talking to the Google guy instead and this hurts me deeply. I\\'ve been sulking in my room everyday since returned from korea. I\\'m just such a boring person. Everyday I ask the same stuff. I want to know how to from an emotioanl connection with enfps. Do you and your partner talk about different things everyday? what do you guys talk about? How do you find new things to talk about for hours everyday? Thanks for reading and helping\\n\\n**Update May 6, 2023**: They are now officially in a relationship (started a few days ago) and she says they love each other (knew each other for 5 months) and she wants to be with him forever and get married eventually. I asked her what is attractive about him. She said he\\'s very gentle, empathetic, and very kind. I said I was basically that except for the empathy part. I don\\'t get angry at her, I usually just listen and try to solve problems. She said he wants her to stop talking to all guys who have interest in her, and she accepted. I asked her why she didn\\'t do that for me when I asked her (when she loved me). She responded by saying that maybe this is the guy she really loves because she wants to do stuff for him. She will slowly distance herself from me to ease my pain and hope that I am happy for her. I felt even more hurt after hearing all this and I fell deeper into the rut. I did my best for her everyday for the past 6 years. I don\\'t know what I could\\'ve done better. She never told me there was anything she didn\\'t like about me. Maybe my appearance? Maybe I was not interesting enough. Or maybe she just lost interest naturallyI\\'m recognizing a pattern where everytime I find a guy I like, I become very realationshippy, but I never want to call it that. And we are also never monogamous. I just really like my freedom, but I also like to be loved.\\n\\nAnd just the other day I decided that I\\'m done with the guy I\\'ve been seeing for over a year. Just *poof* done. Nothing happened, just done. \\n\\nIt kind of scares me how easily an quickely my feelings for a person can change. Makes me wonder if I should ever start something serious with someone. I guess the stereotype of ENFPs being selfish is true for me.. \\n\\nAny other ENFPs that are messed up like me regarding relationships? :(My older brother is an ENFP, I’m an intj. \\nWe’ve gone through some tumultuous times over the past few years, and he tends to get very anxious and emotional when he perceives that I’m being cold/shutting him out/resenting him. \\n\\nHe takes things like not putting an emoji in a text to mean I’m cold and don’t care.  He claims that he has to walk on eggshells when talking to me. When he gets angry, he gets really mean, brings up stuff from the past I thought was fine, and goes below the belt. \\n\\nHe has this need to be liked by everyone and puts others on a pedestal but is far more critical with me. And that’s where I get “triggered”, because it’s hard to see him make nice with relatives that have hurt me, because I view that as disloyalty and I’m very all or nothing. And I definitely think he takes me for granted a lot. He spends time with me if he has time, but he never makes the time. Meanwhile, I’d cancel on people to spend time with my brother.\\n\\nI know that he does love me. And I love him. But we’re very different in terms of our emotional processes and it hurts a lot. I have no idea how to approach this. Asking fellow enfps for advice and if anyone can relate to this.What were the challenges? How did you overcome it? \\n\\nAnything and whatever about your relationship.(EDIT: I can’t believe someone would actually down vote a vulnerable post asking for help, that’s so wild to wrap my head around idk 🤷\\u200d♂️.) I’m a male who has for the past 10-15 years attempted to have/maintain close friendships and deep relationships but I’m now at where I have now developed heavy deep abandonment issues. I am 6’2” blue eyes dark hair and white male american who goes to the gym 3 times a week. (Just trying to paint the picture not looking to be egotistical or whatever it may come across as.)\\n\\nI have a massive problem. There are two sides to me my confident, mysterious, wild sexual, very dominant sexy, high sex drive side or my **wolf** side as I call it. Then I have my empathic, hopeless romantic, self sacrificing, passionate, caring self my more **human** side. (Not literally wolf/human just using analogies.)\\n\\nThe massive problem is people only want me to be the ‘wolf’ they don’t want to get to know the ‘human’ other side of me. Everything is perfect when I am that side for them and I’m very confident in pleasing other people in a rainbow of juicy ways and yes it is a part of who I am.\\n\\nMy other side that requires romance and love and words of affirmation and reassurance of someone’s feelings is STARVED. I am surrounded by people that like me sexually or for my surface level traits and it makes me feel extremely ALONE. I grin and be the wolf and make them happy and have fun but I am on the inside suffering deeply.\\n\\nWhen I open up to someone who I feel like I want to now get close with they are drowned by my passion and see a completely different NEEDY romantic passionate side of me the the held back flood gates reveal, the hopeless romantic. They don’t want to know me only shut up and be the wolf and dom them and host parties and events. So they disappear on me and I go back to being the wolf to get people to connect with me and love me.\\n\\nI don’t know what to do at this point the wolf is a side of me but I’m letting myself be used for sex and fun and charisma to try to get love and intimacy from others and have to hold back my needs and desires and it leaves me abandoned and empty. I non stop get into relationships where the person loves me but just can’t handle me cause I’m too much. I crave kind words and romance and praise and even with my high testosterone and sex drive I am now 100% burnt out on sex and feel like I am 100% demisexual. I love having deep long conversations back n forth and am a leader and protector who is bloodied and broken inside from giving up my needs for others happiness..\\n\\nThis is cringe I know but I’m reaching out into the void for help cause I feel lost. Any advice appreciated.\\n\\nJust got off the plane. While I was flying, I was also contemplating my negative feelings.\\n\\nI hate feeling greedy and unhealthy. I hate feeling discontented. I hate it so much. At what level in Ennea 7 does this happen? Is this usually \"the unhealthy part\"? It\\'s like I slip off \"the healthy levels.\" It even appears in my dreams as well whenever I\\'d look for the meaning. My mental state, inner feelings, fears, appear in my dreams. I dream read alot! I am not happy at all for some reason suddenly. \\n\\nI know myself I appreciate things, I am progressive, I am growing, but I have feelings of discontentment barging in. I don\\'t want to be influenced by anyone to be discontented in life because I do not like the feeling. I feel like I am suffering. Though I have wants for myself, I do not want to go beyond that and I always want to remain true to myself. I unfriended a friend who kept influencing me to join his stupid lifestyle that I do not even want. I impulsively did cuz I can\\'t take it anymore.\\n\\nI just wanna do the things I like such as my intellectual exploration and adventures. I think external factors affect my discontentment. Especially when I am novelty-seeking, I am more vulnerable to it. Though, I do not feel inferior, actually. I only do feel it when I\\'m given a position I do not even deserve.\\n\\nHow? I know myself I am the problem here. I know myself I deserve good things in life, but I dislike the feeling of discontentment. I just wanna be contented in life. \\n\\nGood thing I have awareness because I value alone time, and the stimuli are off. Do I need to find a new activity? Hobbie? Growth? Challenge? What? I wanna work to distract myself from these negative feelings.. but I wanna stop doing that to myself.. I wanna get rid of it rather than distracting myself with work. Maybe I should add more self-growth hobbies? Maybe methods of staying appreciative? \\n\\nI am not always appreciative, happy or whatever. There would be times I\\'d fluctuate out of \"the healthy 7\". I try my best to be a healthy 7, internalizing it more, and good thing I have awareness it\\'s discontentment I\\'m feeling before I do dumb shit or crash down even more. Alone time does really help. \\n\\nAlso, I isolated myself for 2 years. People start typing me as Enneagram 5. Nah, nah. I am just growing and healthy! No, no, no!\\n\\nNow I have awareness, more awareness, I do not want to escape the negative feeling. I do not have any addiction at all and I don\\'t want to be weak, refusing to deal with the actuality of this. I will not distract myself. I will deal with this.\\n\\nDrop some tips, tnx.My bf is an ENTP and we usually have nice and mentally stimulating conversations but he makes it feel like a debate when it doesn\\'t have to(and is kind of.. pedantic about it) and it\\'s annoying when I\\'m not particularly in that mood (is fine when I am). Was wondering if you guys had similar experiences? Like it sometimes feels like an uphill conversation where I have to constantly have the perfect reply or he\\'s not gonna take what I say seriously? If that makes sense. I enjoy talking about hypothetical or controversial shit but it\\'s all for fun, I\\'m not necessarily trying to prove I have the \"right\" take on something, more just to hear other perspectives and maybe change my mind evenHi guys, I am still new to all this MBTI stuff and I have recently found out that I am an ENFP. I feel like discovering this is helping me understand myself. As an ENFP I feel like a main priority on my mind is finding love and giving love to others. \\n\\nIn the past I have chosen people who took my love and dedication for granted and let those people walk all over me. Even though I was aware those relationships were unhealthy I stayed because of my deep love for them and my ability to overlook the bad qualities in them. Even after I ended my last relationship it took me months on months to get over my ex despite being poorly treated.\\n\\nNow that I am finally over my ex, I feel like recently I have been serial dating guys trying to find the guy who will give me the love, dedication, and the attention I want. I want someone to care as deeply about me the same amount I care about them.\\n\\nIt’s been frustrating trying to talk to people recently because it’s hard for me to tell when someone is genuine about me or not.\\n\\nI know a relationship shouldn’t be a persons main priority but I feel that since all the other aspects in like are falling into place, I am just waiting to finally find someone who can give me what I have been desiring from a romantic relationship.\\n\\nIt never feels like anyone is ever as serious as me when it comes to love.😍I’ve met some entps a few days ago, the experience was very interesting and I enjoyed learning and getting to know a different type. I want to get to know more enfps, they are my favorite type by far and in person I get along instantly with you guys but I’d like to know more of enfps brilliances.  I’m an f18 intj. Feel free to comment or dm me personallyGuys, how do ENFPS use their Te? What\\'s an example of an unhealthy Te in them?I feel like I have been mistyping myself ever since I went through the trauma of bullying so I wanted to ask if I am really an INFP or actually just introverted due to trauma.\\n\\nI love people, and want people to be in harmony and to understand each other. If I was able to I would speak to anyone, but I am scared to be rejected or to make people feel awkward so I hold myself back. If people speak to me I do not mind asnwering unless I already have a plan to go somewhere, then I might make the convo short and leave. I would never be rude to someone, even if they were rude to me because I believe everyone deserves respect.\\n\\nI am not so sure if I am truly an introvert because I see myself as a mixture of both ex and introverted.'"

       "'I agree.This is one of many 100 possibilities and not everyone acts the same in a given situation.\\n\\nDon\\'t spit out a random speculation like factsLeave. \\nIf it is a long distance relationship, what do you have except calls and texts? \\n\\nI was in a similar situation a couple of months ago. No texts or any sort of communication whatsoever. \\nHe was very clingy for the first three months. Then started acting distant.\\nWhen I fight about it he would call calm me down. It was a cycle.\\nI can count the number of times he called in a month in one hand during the last 3 months of the relationship. \\n\\nThere was a constant background anxiety and I was feeling super lonely. \\n\\nI tried to chalk up my anxiety to my past trauma.. \\n\\nBut it was too much to handle.\\n\\nI learnt that what I need is consistency. I wouldn\\'t mind a 24 hour gap, if he texts me every 24 hour consistently. \\nBut it got to a point where I had no idea when he will reply /call and whether he will reply or not. \\n\\nI wanted to share my day to day shenanigans with him. \\nWhen I complained he said, write everything you want to share in a paper and tell me when I call. But what is the point of telling him something that happend 6/7 days ago? \\n\\nNow I am talking to another man and I have almost zero anxiety. He is very receptive.\\nThere is consistency always. \\n\\nMaybe your partner got too comfortable and doesn\\'t understand your needs / takes you for granted. \\n\\nRemember your needs are valid. We all have different needs and wants in a relationship and some can be compromised some cannot be compromised.\\nIt is upto you to decide what you can compromise on and what you can\\'t.\\n\\nDon\\'t beat yourself up for having needs. \\n\\nPersonally, I want daily contact long distance or not. \\nIf someone doesn\\'t want the same then that person is not my person.&gt;Looks like his excuse to cover cheating.\\n\\nLMAO what?? Where did this come from? Stop projectingOhh..\\nI am at a dilemma here.\\nI think giving ultimatums actually harm the relationships. And ultimatums are not boundaries.I am not sure whether this will help nevertheless I\\'ll add my two cent. \\n\\nAfter being with a narcissist who blew me hot and cold, I learnt one thing. \\nClosure is something that we come to within our own mind.\\n\\nIt comes when you decide, \"I don\\'t want this anymore. I deserve better. I want something better than this for me\".\\n\\nYou can seek closure anywhere you want. But ultimately, it comes from within.Came here to see whether someone has mentioned this.\\nWhy is withholding information wrong?\\nEspecially in this case the OP has broke up after a month.\\nI think some people are not comfortable sharing a lot about themself that early in a relationship. (I don\\'t know the context. Maybe they both knew each other prior. Then it is a different story)\\n\\nLying is of course shitty.I meant my new habbit of giving ultimatums when shit hits the fan. \\n\\nNot going into relationships.What were the challenges? How did you overcome it? \\n\\nAnything and whatever about your relationship.I relate to this totally.\\n\\nIt is always the other person who ends the relationship with me even though I play a part in it. \\n\\nI dated one fucked up ISTJ who is avoidant, and I learnt giving ultimatums in relationships after that. \\nI should stop that bad habbit.Thank you very much!!This is solid advice but it is all a shit show now.\\n\\nI have already shared about my past issues with him..\\n\\nPlus, he thinks it is not good to get money from women. So offering him to pay for the date is also out of the table.\\n\\nHis Fi seems immature.Thank you for this reasonable answer. \\n\\nHe is not a virgin. He has more experience than me sexually. \\n\\n&gt;What I do agree with though, is that this has nothing to do with a personality type\\n\\nThis has a lot to do with personality type. Unfortunately not a single comment addressed it.\\nHis Fi got triggered and what happened was an Fi out burst. \\nThat is why I posted here. Even though I am an Fi user I don\\'t have much idea about how tertiary Fi operates. \\n\\nThe building walls is completely Fi behaviour - shutting off when hurt.\"Remind me! June 3rd\"This might sound stupid.\\n\\nI (F 26 ENFP) started chatting with an INTJ (25, M) via a dating app a month ago. \\nWe clicked immediately and spent time texting constantly having lot of great convos and sexting a lot. \\nWe were planning to meet. But it got postponed twice, due to some reasons. He didn\\'t give a proper explanation and due to my past experiences, I started getting suspicious. \\n\\nI jumped into conclusion too soon and sent s long text, along the lines of, \"prove yourself. I am losing interest and that is why I am not so enthusiastic about sexting these days\". (Not verbatim. Just the gist of my message. I can post the message in a comment.) I was quite harsh. \\n\\nThe message has affected him and hurt him. And I assume, I made him feel rejected.\\nHe didn\\'t tell me anything about it at first. But we started sexting once after the fight and I got turned off inbetween due to personal reasons. After that he just bursted and said things aren\\'t same for him after the fight and he decided never to sext with me. But he went against that and thought we can bring back things to normal but I made it worse etc. Until he said that I had no idea what\\'s going on with him. \\n\\nAnyway, now we have good convos. \\nBut the connection doesn\\'t feel the same. I told him that he has built walls. \\nIt hurts. I didn\\'t do anything intentionally. \\n\\nIs there anything I could do to help the situation?&gt;Well ENFP is really life to the fullest.\\nReally admire this traits.\\n\\nAs an ENFP I cannot relate to this at all.\\n\\nI mean, I am very very possessive and strictly monogamous.Hey, I think I can give you some perspective. \\nI am also from an abusive family.\\nSo I understand your issue to certain degree.\\nMy main way of coping is emotionally detaching me from my parents and not care about their opinions.\\nBut it has affected me on so many levels. \\n\\nI don\\'t understand how your bf will get to know your parents opinions in a LDR. \\n\\nJust keep them to yourself. And don\\'t care. Detach from them. You don\\'t have to inform them tvo your bf. \\nYou don\\'t have to defend. The part of you that defends your bf from your parents expects to a certain degree to change their behaviour. But that is not wise. Expecting others to change or control their behaviour is never going to work.Oh..\\nI have heard INTJs breaking relationships bcz of distance. \\nThis is the first time I am hearing Enfp do that \\nBut I think once an INTJ is IN they are in it for a lifetime. \\n\\n&gt;I just like how Intjs think and see the world\\n\\nYou must make a post about it!Love this!\\nThis is beautiful!I was in a similar situation a month ago.\\nIt was not over the text but a person whom I know in person. I had only known him for maybe a week or two. And he didn\\'t give me any reason to believe he is into me. \\nWe didn\\'t even have much conversations.\\n\\nBut, I found him to be **different** than other people and developed an interest in getting to know him better. \\n\\nI had another problem during that time. One of my long term friend didn\\'t invite me to her wedding and I felt very sad and an intense feeling of rejection. Which then made me turn my whole attention to this guy as a coping mechanism and I got very obsessed with him. \\n\\nAnd he wasn\\'t direct with him in his rejection. A direct, I am not interested in you would have helped me. But he was very vague and beating around the bush and it made me push harder. \\n\\nI have a tendency to obsess over someone / something inorder to forget / swipe my negative feelings under the rug.\\n\\nNot saying this is what she is doing. But it is a possiblity. How old is she?&gt;Just be cold and harsh. Tell her that you are really not interested in her, that you don’t wanna see her and that you can’t imagine falling in love with her in any way. It’s what she needs. If you say “You’re a great woman, I really like you but we’re not meant to be…” you will just make her believe that she’ll have some chance, someday. You don’t want her to have hope. \\n\\nOp this.Thank you! \\nThis is a well thought out comment!I am sorry you are going through this. \\nMaybe, you are not over your ex yet.\\n\\nWho initiated the breakup?The whole fight happened because he cancelled. \\n\\nI have been abandoned by men who has kept talking to me for months and then got cold feet when I wanted to meet in person. \\n\\n\"Failed his test\" - LMAO, you guys test people?Awww... \\n\\nYes. He said he looked at the situation from my POV. \\nBut he said from his POV he can\\'t simply accept the way I behaved. He said he felt disrespected. \\nHe said he felt pushed away from me because what I said. \\n\\nIntuitively I feel that he is scared of being hurt (again, by me) so he is keeping his distance.Thank you!\\nI appreciate your comment..\\nI apologized sincerely. And I genuinely realized my mistake.\\nI have been projecting my past onto him for a while and I realized how unfair it is for him.Yes. I am anxiously attached. And I have a fear of abandonment. \\nI have tried all that I can. Meditation, inner child healing, journaling and what not.\\nTherapy is unaffordable at this moment for me.I started talking with an INTJ over a dating app and we clicked immediately. \\nWe started chatting day and night and every day for long durations. Even the whole night sometimes.\\n\\nWe planned to meet in person but he had to postpone the plans. \\nI started getting suspicious of him because of this. \\nI have so many past bad experiences where I trusted the wrong people. \\nSo, I fell into an Si grip, started ruminating and out of the blue, I sent him a long text somewhere along the lines of \"prove yourself\". \\nThat wasn\\'t my intention. I was mad hurt that he postponed the plans. I started to worry that maybe I am not as important to him as him to me. \\nBut, nevertheless, he read between the lines and he was right. It was subconscious in my part. But the message meant, \"Prove yourself, so that I can trust you\". \\n\\nHe started acting distance from that day onwards. \\nHe still talks with me. He said that he could have said goodbye, but he couldn\\'t. \\n\\nWe had a long conversation about it and ultimately he said, \\n\"You could have taken things slowly, if you don\\'t trust me. Instead you jumped right in and then getting suspicious of my words.\" \\n\\nHe talks, but it is different. We both feel the difference. It hurts so much.\\nI don\\'t know what to do.If that is how you feel, then she is not worth talking to. \\n\\nFind other friends.I can\\'t say anything until more time has passed \\n\\nHow many hours has passed in total?Hello!I thought that there aren\\'t enough choices of flairs and the option to create new flairs while posting should be better.&gt;I hate ignoring people because I prefer to be there for them.\\n\\nAnd I hate to be ignored also30 mins won\\'t be enough for me.Yes! \\nI am working on self actualizing. I am trying to \"fill my cup\" as you say.\\nIt is hard. Takes a lot of patience and practise. \\n\\n&gt;He\\'s definitely not my whole world. But I appreciate him a lot.\\n\\nGood that you are in that place..\\nNever put him in a pedestal. Again I have done that with INTJs. My admiration has turned into me subconsciously put people in a pedastal. \\n\\nComing back to your original question of \"are Intjs and ENFPs even a good match\". \\nNobody can tell that for you. Each and every person is unique. Sure that there are certain common characteristics. But ultimately personality is a blend of nature and nurture. \\n\\nNot every INTJs man you encounter is going to be like your brother. There might be some like your brother. Some vastly different..\\nI think you have to get to know that person slowly and decide for yourself whether he is a good match for you or not.\\nDefinitely it shouldn\\'t be based on MBTI types.I know.. we ENFPs have a tendency to jump right in. Imagine all possibilities.. dream up a future together etc etc. We have all been there. \\nSlow down girl. \\n\\nGiving this amount of priority to a man, you have only known for a week?? Do you think it\\'s healthy?\\n\\nLearn to look at people beyond their MBTI type. If he is hurting you then he is hurting you. If he is lying then he is a liar. If he is acting like a jerk then he is a jerk. No matter the MBTI type. \\nI used to blindly trust people who lied to me face bcz they are INTJ and they are honest. \\nHave sticked so longer to a manipulating asshole cz he an INFJ and he is my golden pair. \\nBeen there. Done all that shit. \\n\\nNever let a man become your whole world while your life takes a back seat. Always walk along your path. Your ambitions, hobbies whatever. And let the man slowly walk along you and then hold your hand if he wants. Give him space to join along you. But never abandon your journey, your path and try to jump into his path. \\nTo do this, you first have to have a journey for yourself. No matter how small. If you enjoy playing chess, and you have played chess everyday at 7pm, then don\\'t stop doing that for a man you know for a week. If you have planned to cook / watch cooking video at 7pm daily, then don\\'t change or abandon your plans for a man. \\nAt 27, I am still learning this and struggling with this. \\n\\nAll what I have said is the mistakes I have made in the past. \\n\\nIf a man is ruining your mental peace, he is not worth it.\\nThere was this INTJ man, I came across in Tinder. I wanted to build that connection further. After 2 days of chatting, I didn\\'t hear from him. I was pining over him.. checking messages every hour at night for maybe 3,4 days. Then I realized I don\\'t want that in my life. Unmatched that man and moved on with my life. \\n\\nHopefully you gain something from this.I have also have reasons to believe that he might not be an INTJ. \\n1. He is quite social. Teases and jokes around a lot. It looks like Fe. \\n2. While speaking he also showed some traits of Fi. Used a lot of \"I\" sentences.. \\n3. He also randomly asks questions around like, what do you think of this? Etc. Looked like Ne. \\nI initially thought he might be INFP or ENFP..\\nHe also shares a lot. Once a questions is asked, he volunteers information related to that and elaborates a lot rather than just answering the question curtly. \\n\\n&gt;after my experiences with ENFPs it sounds like something I\\'d tell every single ENFP from now on. \\n\\nCan you elaborate more on your experiences?You don\\'t always have to explain your behaviour..\\nJust go with the ride and enjoy your phases. As long as you are emotionally healthy it is all fine.\\nWith time I am realising that personality is not static but fluid. Our behaviours, thoughts all change according to situation, time and age! \\n\\n&gt;shallow” people drain us! It’s so true!\\n\\nWith experience you will learn to understand your capacity for social interaction and limit it jn a way that will be optimally beneficial to you.\\n Earlier I was open to friendship with anybody and interact with everybody, sometimes just out of politeness. Now I am much more careful of who I let into my circle and who I interact with. \\nSocial interactions are all exchange of energy and we have to be careful about with whom and how we exchange it.Thank you for sharing your experience! \\n\\n&gt;wasn\\'t into me, but SHE ENJOYED BEING PURSUED by me.\\n\\nThat\\'s so mean and evil. \\n\\n&gt;At one point her rejection finally became evident.\\n\\nMay I ask you to elaborate the story? \\n\\nI am glad that you are out of it. And I can sense your ENFP optimistic outlook towards the world! \\n\\nHugs!Thank you for your kind words. \\n\\n&gt;I always believe that being direct about these kinds of things is kinder in the long run. \\n\\nI believe the same thing! I have been rejected directly and it was the easiest thing to navigate through.Thank you! .Idk his type.\\nCouldn\\'t clearly identify any functions to type him. Plus, we didn\\'t spend enoug time together for me to arrive at a conclusion.\\nThis is a guy, I was interested in. He was the one who spoke to me first. Just teasing here and there. And he does that with everyone. Which piqued my interest. Then I started dropping hints. Then I directly asked him whether he is married / in a relationship and then I got his number. \\nThen I started texting him.\\nThere wasn\\'t much reply to my messages from him. So I tried to ignore him. But whenever I was tried to just ignore him he talks with me in person and acknowledges the messages I send. \\n\\n\\nIn my state of excitement I completely failed to see the subtle signs of rejection. \\nSince he kept acknowledging my messages in person even though he didn\\'t reply consistently.  I thought maybe there was some interest. Atleast a potential for a good friendship. \\n\\nI tried to strike up conversations whenever possible and get to know him. Then I asked him to meet outside somewhere. First time I asked he said no immediately, saying he prefers to go out alone. I took it as a rejection tried to stay away from him.\\n\\nBut then, he again striked up friendly conversations so I asked him out again. He turned me down again, advising me to enjoy my company alone.\\n\\n&gt;Then, one day, I went straight to him and told him I have a huge crush on him.\\nTo which he replied, \"I wouldn\\'t have let you come to that place. (Whatever that means god knows.)\" \\nThen I said, \"I find you very interesting. And I want to know more about you\" \\nHe said, \"now you will find me interesting. Then you will get bored. I am not an interesting or positive person as you think. You don\\'t know anything about me.\" \\nI said, \"I am aware that I don\\'t know anything about you. Hence I want to get to know you better\". \\n\\nIt was quite awkward.  I definitely didn\\'t convey my thoughts clearly. But I made it clear that I was into him.\\n\\n The last time we spent time was on last Saturday. It was the last day of my rotation in the ward he is working. So I went to bid goodbye to him.\\n\\nBut he made me stay there and do some clerical work for him. It wasn\\'t crazy amount of work and there were other people to help him. So it seemed like he wanted me to stay so that we can spend time together. (Maybe I misread it) \\n\\nWe spent a lot of time together that day. We had a great conversation. \\n\\nAt some point I left and then came back again because I remembered about something he said and I wanted to clarify it. (It was about a book he has read. To be specific, the book was brief answers to big questions by Stephen Hawkin and I had a hard time accepting the theory about the non-existent of god.) I wanted to know my crush\\'s explanation.\\n\\nThen after discussing that, while I was trying to leave he gave me some more work. (Which was quite surprising. Bcz I have felt some awkwardness / he running away from me usually) \\nBut on the contrary he willingly made me spend time with me that day. \\n\\nTwo days later, I texted him. Two different quotes.\\nAnd I didn\\'t get a reply or any sort of acknowledgment to those texts..\\nIt really sucked. \\nThen it was his birthday yesterday and around 6pm I sent him a birthday wish.Nothing crazy. Just \"heyy! Happy birthday!\" I did not get any reply at all.\\n\\nI feel completely disrespected. I am really upset. I wish people were direct when they reject. Instead of beating around the bush. I said him directly I had a crush on him and I wish to know him better. Atleast then had he said, \"I don\\'t have any interest in you\" , it would have been easier..\\n\\nObviously I was caught up in so much of emotions and I failed pickup on the signs due to my cognitive bias.\\n\\nThis is a great lesson to tone down my enthusiasm and slow down a bit and analyse the situation next time. \\n\\nBut this really sucks. I have handled breakups and direct rejections better. This is the first time I am being caught up in a situation like this. \\n\\nPlease give me any advice / support. I need that.OP this. \\nDon\\'t fight against your feelings. \\nJust accept that they are there.\\nDon\\'t judge your emotions. Don\\'t fight against them. \\n\\nWith time you will be okay.I have been waiting to chime in this. \\n\\nhttps://personalitygrowth.com/the-introvert-enfp/\\n\\nThere you go check this. \\n\\nPlus, I believe most of ENFPs are actually mistyped ENTPs..\\nI don\\'t relate to the sterotypical \"people person\" at all. And I think it can\\'t be true for people with Fi. \\nOn the contrary ENTPs have Fe and the only ENTP I know said how he enjoys striking up conversations with strangers. \\n\\n\\nAlso quoting from the following article \\nhttps://personalityjunkie.com/enfp/\\n\\n&gt; One of the more important features of Fi is its direction. Namely, because it is introverted, outsiders may not have easy access to ENFPs’ emotions, with the exception of their general spiritedness and enthusiasm. Like ESFPs, ENFPs express their Feeling judgments somewhat indirectly through their Te. This may at times lead others to view ENFPs as Thinking types, while seeing ENTPs, who extravert their judgments by way of Extraverted Feeling, as Feeling types.Oh.. I didn\\'t update.\\nNow I think he might either be Intp or INTJ.\\n\\nBut I have given up on him completely.\\nThere wasn\\'t much reciprocation or any sort of interest from his part.\\n\\nAnd the rejection really sucked. \\n\\nIn our culture not everybody wears a ring. So I had no choice but to ask.\\n\\nWell, I think it is better to be upfront than beat around the bush \\n\\nAnd I didn\\'t want to hit on someone who is taken. Did that once without knowing that person was taken and I still can\\'t fully get over than embarrassment.Check out inner child healing. \\nThe holistic psychologist in youtube and insta helped me a lot. \\n\\nAlso ditch that bf of yours. I have been in a similar situation.\\nINTJ.. said I love you . But can\\'t marry you. Be my half gf.  Etc .\\n\\nDone with that shitI don\\'t try to maintain friends. \\nI have a notion (which maybe totally wrong) that Fi can\\'t maintain a large circle. So I stick to my small circle of people. \\nOthers, I socialise in person, whenever I meet them. \\nI don\\'t actively try to text and maintain friendships. That is very cumbersome and small talks drain me very much.Most NFs are misfit in the world and mostly unhealthy. \\n\\nI am yet to meet an emotionally healthy INFP.&gt;ENTJ, ENFJ, ESTP, ESFP, ENFP the most masculine MBTI - not related to societal masculinity. \\n\\nBeing an ENFP, I have never felt feminine in my life.. and I feel more powerful and like myself when I stay that way. \\nI am a go getter. I go behind what I want. Including pursuing the men I like.  \\n🤔I guess there is an overlap between societal masculinity and MBTI masculinity? \\n\\n&gt;INFP: crybaby, soft\\n\\n&gt;Refer to part3: one of the most egocentric and stubborn types \\n\\nSooo true... \\n\\n&gt;Fi is a Ji function. Its about the focus on personal values. They are somewhat detached, egocentric , very stubborn, and only show certain parts of themselves to people.\\n\\nNever heard an accurate description.May I know what reason she said?Thank you very much for this account! \\nI needed this so much! Your thoughts resonate with me on a deeper level. I always tend to look for lessons I learn. \\n\\n&gt;The seed of change has been planted and maybe that’s all you were meant to do for him. And that’s OK.\\n\\nExactly the kind of change he planted in me. He inspired me on certain aspects and I am greatful for that! \\n\\nI always trust the process of the universe and believe that whatever happens shall ultimately be great. \\n\\n&gt;But the urge not to listen to our own experiential wisdom is actually just morbid curiosity, the bane of all Ne/Se doms.\\n\\nThis is eye opening! This is a piece of information I haven\\'t come across anywhere while reading and thank you so much for sharing it. \\n\\n\\n&gt;letting go, I’d say it’s not Ne that needs work \\n\\nI meant working on my Ne in a general sense. Not regard to this circumstance..\\nI was in an abusive relationship in my teenage and following that my growth was hindered very much. I had to pick up myself from the ground level. \\nI am also surrounded by people with herd mentality, who don\\'t have the slightest level of curiosity for anything. It depressed my Ne very much. With time, I slowly lost my curious mind, questioning everything and searching for answers. Instead I started accepting everything at face value and lost my spark. \\n\\nNow I am seeing the return of my curious mind, thanks to the happy hormones due to this crush, and the inspiration I gained from him and some support. \\nI realised what it means to be a true ENFP with an unending curiosity. But my Ne needs a bit of encouragement due to being suppressed for so long. Whenever I ask questions, I am looked down upon as asking unnecessary questions by my collegues. \\n\\nNow I have decided not to suppress my curious mind just cz others around me can\\'t meet me at my own level. \\n\\n\\n&gt;You were being yourself, a curious and loving person. You offered to be closer and he didn’t go for it. That can mean million things and 75% of those meanings have nothing to do with you\\n\\nThanks a million for this! \\n&lt;3I am not sure whether he is an INFP or ENFP. I saw both Fi and Ne in him. Fi seemed more prominent, but he is outwardly very social, so he can very well be a well matured ENFP. \\n\\nSaying that, I am in the process of developing my Fi and myself and I believe any relationship must have both people meet each other in the middle. I don\\'t prefer to chase him for xxxx / yyyyy reasons. \\n\\nMy previous relationship was with an INFP, who was very insecure and had so many issues but wasn\\'t aware of them or willing to work on them. I am not saying it was entirely his mistake, but at the end we weren\\'t able to bridge the gap. Therefore, I am very reluctant to pursue INFPs. \\n\\nSpeaking of this man, I think he is INFP bcz I did not see much Te in him. ENFPs tend to be more straightforward and goal oriented. He didn\\'t directly address me hitting on him, until I forced him to have a direct conversation about, me having a crush on him.\\nWhich is sort of a turn off. \\n\\nI am never ever going to fall into my \"savior\" mindset again. If he chooses to live a lonely life, then it us upto him. I believe people should learn to take chances. Grab opportunities. For whatever reasons, he did not want to give me a chance - not for dating but spend some time and see how we align. \\n\\nI wish him all the best and greatful for the lessons he taught me.\\n\\nMaybe, he sensed that I was a bit obsessive over him..maybe he intuitively felt we are not compatible. \\n\\nI sensed his Ne and Fi both being very well developed. My Ne is not well developed even if it is my first function. I am going to focus on developing myself.\\n\\n(PS - the complete rejection sucks. The way he chose to keep me at arms distance and not to engage on a deeper level, or have deep conversations. I am starved for intuitive connections)Thank you! \\nThere are mixed reponses here.. \\nSome supporting this process, while others don\\'t. I am quite confused now.Maybe, I should learn to set boundaries.I had such a phase too...Our situation is a bit complicated. \\n\\nHe is an intern doctor and I am a final year medical student. \\n\\nHe seems very friendly outwardly on a superficial level.\\nHe jokes around with the staffs and teases us all. Which piqued my interest first. \\n\\nI made the first move, asked him whether he is married and then got his number. \\n\\nBut he didn\\'t respond to my texts much. But he speaks in person. Very friendly. \\n\\nIt was quite confusing.\\n\\nThen I tried to avoid him bcz of the mixed signals. But I couldn\\'t.\\n\\nSo, I went straight and told him that I have a huge crush on him, and that I find him very interesting. \\n\\nHis reaction to that was quite unexpected. He was like neutral? \\n(He was wearing face mask so I am not sure) \\nBut then he was like.. advicing me.. (I guess he looks at me like a \\'small\\' / immature girl? \\nHe was like, yeah, getting crushes is normal. It is not a big thing. You might find me interesting now.. but soon it will fade away. You don\\'t know anything about me. I am not really a positive person as you think.. I am quite a negative person. \\n\\nAnd I was like, yeah, I don\\'t know anything about you. But I want to know more. That is why I asked to meet you somewhere. But you weren\\'t interested. \\n\\nI asked to meet him somewhere outside, twice. Both times he refused saying, he prefers to go out alone. And he enjoys his own company. The second time, he was even telling me, \"you need to enjoy your own company\". \\n\\nI wrote about him and my experiences in my blog. I will send you the linkI have made my move already.. \\nHe is unreadable...\\nI just assumed that \"he is just not that into me\"... \\n\\nI intuitively feel that he might like me a tiny bit but he is guarded.. \\n\\nBut who knows..Aww.. \\nAlright this is a very different perspective..\\nI shall think about it..Thank you so much!!! \\n\\nThis is a very powerful message!&gt;High school, so im guess that you are fairly young in age,\\n\\nNope, I am 27 this year. The said friend is from a decade ago.I might need some of your wisdom...Why would you ask this? 😭😭\\n\\nI am currently head over heels for an Infp man who doesn\\'t like me the same way.\\n\\nHe is so vulnerable. He is VERY VERY KIND. He has tons of patience! \\nHe is very intelligent. \\n\\nIt is like we kinda get each other.. \\n\\nHe thinks a lot like me. \\nHe is very funny and he is very humble.\\nAnd he reads books!Hello ENFPs, did you ever go through a transition period where you felt the need to ditch all your friends and find new people / stay in solitude? \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI am feeling a complete aversion towards people I don\\'t feel connected to. \\n\\nPeople who only engage in small talks, people with whom I only share a history with and nothing in common, people who are not capable of deep conversations beyond the regular day to day conversations, people who are against don\\'t align with my values (for eg. Who care about social status rather than authenticity), people who are excessively negative, people who wallow in self pity and self hatred, people with whom I don\\'t experience a conversation flow... \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThese are the kind of people I have in my life now. I feel a complete aversion for them. I feel like I want to run away from all of that. \\n\\nFor eg, a high school classmate called me today and after talking with her for 30mins, I felt completely drained and I didn\\'t feel connected to her / felt like I could be my authentic self with her. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI feel aversion towards people with whom I can\\'t be my authentic self.. for whom I have to purposely hide parts of myself / showcase a curated version. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nOn the other hand, I am feeling guilty for wanting to cut off my old friends.. \\n\\nAlso, I am wondering whether I could just be going into depression.. or is this actually a part of growing and maturing? \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI was also told by a person I look upto, to learn to keep people at relevant distances accordingly. I am trying to learn this... But I am kinda bad at it. And I am also feeling extreme guilt for feeling aversion towards people who have been by me and helped me at times of need in the past. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nPlease help.Is your studying effective? \\n\\nIt sounds like you might be in an Ne-Te loop where you have sort of run out of optimism so you try to drown yourself in studying.. which is not actually productive but just gives an illusion of productivity. \\n\\nCheck in with your Fi. Take some time alone.Something happened in my life. I (F) pursued my crush like a man...\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nA friend of mine said that I had ruined my reputation by acting that way. \\n\\nI am totally pissed and want to drop that friendship. Fuck social norms. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI was being myself, following my heart and felt very powerful, while pursuing that man. It felt great to not worry about the rules and what others might think of me. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nBut I feel completely invalidated after my friend said that to me. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nWhat am I to do? I really want to distance myself from the said friend, inorder to grow as a person. \\n\\nIn my point of view, being myself is what will bring me emtional health.Thank you very much!!I am a medical student and I have a similar problem where my collegues view me as stupid bcz they don\\'t have the ability to follow my way of thoughts. I am always a step ahead of them and ask questions, but they can\\'t follow me so they think that it is an unnecessary or irrelevant thing. But it is relevant. \\n\\nMy grades being down in the dumps doesn\\'t help my situation either.Thank youuuuu &lt;3Thank you very much. \\nI needed to hear this!Thank you very much for this message. \\n\\nI am just all over the place. I am hurting. \\nI am aware of the mistakes I made in the above relationship and I am trying to correct myself. \\nFor eg:- I attached too quickly. \\n\\nBut.. why just can\\'t I have love? Lol.Yes. I have blocked him. But I am not yet over him or the situation. \\n\\n&gt;The greatest peace you will ever give yourself is learning to overcome your anxious attachment. \\n\\nBro.. I am trying :(&gt;Take all the time you need. Cry about it. You\\'ll get better in your own time.\\n\\nThank you! &lt;3I am anxiously attached. I know that for a while. I have been working on it. \\n\\n&gt;Because if you were secure in yourself you wouldn\\'t accept his breadcrumbs. But maybe you did because that\\'s all you thought you were worth? \\n\\nI can\\'t say I necessarily accepted his breadcrumbs. \\nThere was a bit of manipulation here and there. Where towards the end he turned his lack of attention as a problem of mine! While I kept demanding for attention, he was blaming me for not focusing on my work, instead just bothering him. \\n\\nAnyway, my past self wouldn\\'t have initiated a breakup. But I initiate a breakup in the beginning stages of him pulling away. I am so proud of doing that. \\nThe mistake I did was, letting him manipulate and coerce me to stay in the relationship. \\nHe told I was not being understanding of his situation. So I beleived it.&gt;I would advise you to not initiate a relationship without ever meeting in person\\n\\nYes. I understand that now. I learn lessons slowly. LolThis happened in mid November and the pain hits me randomly.\\nWe were long distance haven\\'t met in person. I got to know him in a dating app. \\nInitially I was only talking to alliviate my loneliness. \\nHe wanted to make it official. \\nWe spent a lot of time together in the first 3 months. We watched movies together while on video call etc. It almost felt like we were living together bcz we spent so much of time together. \\nThen everything changed. He got busy with work. And the communication dropped. \\nThe number of calls we had dropped from everyday to 10days to 8days to 6 days per month. \\nI wasn\\'t getting enough attention. I felt very lonely in the relationship. \\nI said him several times he only gave excuses and nothing changed. \\nI tried to end things in the first month itself when things started to go south. But he didn\\'t want to. So I thought maybe he wanted this to really workout. \\n\\nWhenever I got upset, he would call and just sweet talk me and that was that. \\n\\nI got very frustrated and one day I gave him an ultimatum. \\nI told him to get his shit together and find time to allocate for the relationship. I also asked him regarding his plans for our future..\\nThat was that. He ended things then and there over a text. Said, \"don\\'t contact me and don\\'t expect me to respond to you hereafter\". \\nThat was the last time I heard from him. \\n\\nI mailed him several times, even begging him to talk with me once. \\n\\nIt\\'s just sad. \\nI searched around and realized maybe he is avoidantly attached..apparently this is how they behave. I have a history of falling for the worst kind of men.. since he was very attentive initially I didn\\'t expect this to end THIS way. \\n\\nA part of me still wonders whether he got distance because of something I said or did. \\n\\nWhen I am with someone I am loyal to a fault. It wouldn\\'t have taken me a second to do something behind his back. But I never would have. \\nI don\\'t know why he failed to see my worth? How hard it is to find someone as loving as me? \\nHe is an INFP if that matters. \\n\\nThanks for reading.Fake it till you make it?May you find peace..That is what life is all aboutThank you!Read what you wrote again. \\nObviously you are telling something to OP based on your own personal assumptions that stems from your personal experience, while looking at the situation objectively would be to tell OP to set his own boundaries.People have mentioned the positives. So I\\'ll go with the negatives. \\nI have one friend and we had a lot of Ti-Te and Fi-Fe clash. \\nThe Ne connection is insane. \\nWe can tolerate each other on small doses.\\nBut our connection is entirely via chats. Not in real life.Sounds like unhealthy Ne and underdeveloped Fi. \\nFi is where your moral integrity comes. \\n\\nTo gain one thing means to lose on something else. \\nIf you keep on breaking up relationships then you are not going to find a long term partnership. \\n\\nFirst understand what you require in a relationship. Then take time and reflect and decide before getting into a relationship. Learn to lose things to gain what you want. \\nFor eg. If you want a long term partnership then you must be able to let go of wanting constant excitement. A long term partnership is definitely going to be boring on some level because stability is boring. \\nNobody can have it all.&gt;how? \\n\\nText them, send memes, images, videos, whatever just connect with them... And then go ahead from there. At one point you can let them know that you want something more than friendship. But I am sure that INFPs are good in reading people\\'s emotions so if it is going to be reciprocrated you will know it. \\n\\n&gt;What kind of people ENFPs like?\\n\\nWrong question. Only a couple of traits are not likeable for me. Constant lying, cheating, being an asshole, manipulating, selfishness etc. \\nOther than that I find something good in everyone.\\n\\nBut, confidence is always sexy. Be confident and straightforward. It can go a long wayEvery single word mentioned here. \\n\\nI can\\'t understand how in the world u/edgewaterenchantress came to the conclusion that the OPs gf is just being silly and making *JoKeS* \\nWhy can\\'t she be actually flirting? \\nThose are flirty words anyway. \\n\\nI wouldn\\'t personally call anybody other than my partner such names.\\n&gt;Good for you that you got out of that relationship!! \\n\\nThank you! \\n\\nMbti subs are filled with immature people who attribute each and every human trait to MBTI. \\nI stay away from these subs a lot for that reasonJust go for it! \\nMy boyfriend is an INFP and after so many toxic relationships he is a breath of fresh air!This ☝️Joking vs pet name calling is different for god\\'s sake.There is a difference between making jokes and using pet names on other men.OP is clearly distressed and that is why he is here. The gist of majority of the comments are \"that is how ENFPs are. It is YOUR problem. Suck it up\" \\n\\nIt is clearly inappropriate and unempathetic and unreasonable. \\n\\nOn a side note, a friend of mine did this to me. Whenever I bring up my narc ex\\'s inappropriate behavious he would go \"that is how men are\". I am glad I cut off both garbage.My INFP boyfriend is like that too. (Used to be) and we are in a long distance relationship. \\nUsually we just watched movies together and stuff and his love language is quality time. \\n\\nI brought this up and he said, \"I am not an expressive person\". \\nBut, I require words of affirmations. \\nI had a conversation about it with him and said him how him not showing me affection via texts makes it feels like he is more of a \"brother\" than a boyfriend. \\nEver since, he started sending kissing emojis and \"I love you\"s and now we always end a call with an \"I love you\" even though he didn\\'t understand the point of it initially. Now he is totally into it!You missed the word *selfishThank you very much for sharing this. \\nYou are so strong and powerful. \\nBut, remember it is alright to trust the wrong people, it is alright to be naive sometimes and it is alright to be weak. \\n\\nJust don\\'t direct anger at yourself. (Perhaps it is just part of the process). Try and slowly come out at the other side of things.I personally feel most of these comments are just immature and gaslighting. \\n\\nYou set your boundaries in a relationship. If what your gf did made you uncomfortable tell her that you won\\'t accept it. If she is not willing to respect that then move on.I was in a relationship with a narcissist and after breaking up I was completely directionless. \\nI used to be a studious person. I am in med school. But I had zero desire to study ever since I got into med school. \\nI blamed it on various things. Tried a lot of tricks but nothing worked.\\n\\nI read an article about narcs a couple of days ago and it said, \"they will make anything and everything into something about them!\". And it clicked. \\n\\nHe brainwashed me into believing that I have to study to finally get married to him. Because of cultural issues, he convinced me that me becoming a doctor (achieving a higher social standard) is the only way that he can get his parents to accept me. \\nI was already working my ass off to get into med school. BUT he made it all ABOUT HIM. And I believed that nonsense. \\nSo after breakup I was completely lost and directionless. He made everything about me into something about him. Even my fucking ambition!  \\n\\nOnly a couple of days ago I realized that I studied because I love learning. And I am naturally a studious person and I simply love being studying. (Getting into med school is based off A/L exam results here. So I basically had to come into top 1200 in the whole country) \\n\\nI am still mind baffled after this realization. \\nCouldn\\'t say this any of my friends cz they don\\'t simply understand narcissism.\\n\\nHad to get that off my chest. Thank you!&gt;I know some things that you’d be surprised if you found out\\n\\nHaha. I know a lot of people\\'s secrets that they don\\'t know of me knowingI am very good at lying at home. I think it comes from growing up with strict parents. When I lie, I plan it well. When, where my mom would be at a specific time. Who else my mom might come across and hence my lies get caught etc. \\nI lie to do what I want at home cz they won\\'t understand otherwise. \\n\\nOther than that, I don\\'t lie. \\nHave said a white lie here and there. But I despise lies.You should not \"think\" about loving someone. Do it your way. \\nMost importantly, give them the love they expect / want. \\nLearn about love languages and speak their languageAha 😂'"

       "'So doing nothing eventually stops the anxiety?Jealous women?I\\'m very open minded and now I\\'m starting to think I was once too open minded with little boundaries on my part. I have a lot of friends and made a lot of them over the course of my life but with the downside of that I\\'ve made a lot of enemies or ex friends. I made the mistake trying to befriend everyone not realizing not everyone has good intentions or is a decent person. It bums me out thinking about it. I\\'m older now and set better boundaries with people but I cringe when I think about all the psychotic and terrible people I let into my life just because I was lonely, saw the good in them, and wanted to befriend them.Did overtime you feel less anxious around your partner?I didn\\'t have these issues years back when I met my partner but my PTSD came out of nowhere last year and has gotten worse and worse now its attacking my partner and my brain is thinking I\\'ll react to him the way I did with my abusive father and ex.\\n\\n\\nHow do I stop this? I love my husband and he\\'s nothing like my abusers but my brain is trying to kill meI used to say stupid stuff like I\\'d rather have cancer but what I actually mean is that I\\'d rather go thru something horrible with no anxiety or traumatic aftermath than deal with the situation I\\'m in that caused me anxiety. Obviously some traumas people can handle better than others. I quit saying dumb stuff like this because I realized at the end of the day it\\'s the anxiety reaction that is causing my distress not the specific situationThe longer we sit with anxiety the more it goes away? I\\'m trying to figure out how this works with exposure therapy and intrusive thoughts and worriesI\\'ve seen this comment thousands of times today all over tiktok and reddit posts talking about how our country is on a list of dangerous countries to visit or something \\n\\nI like it here I don\\'t get itAre you on any meds?Ok and I still value my life and quality of living?Exactly. I don\\'t like it when people look at me baffled when I say no I dont want to leave the USA. Obviously I\\'m horrified by what\\'s going on but not all of us have the privilege to leaveI\\'m tired of people acting like it is so easy to just drop everything and move to another country. Some of us have obligations and family or anxiety about moving or flyingInterestedMaybe lithium orotateInteresting how we develop different phobias. I developed agoraphobia and never thought in a millions years I would have a fear like that until I withdrew from a cocktail of meds.\\n\\nI feel kinda lame. I don\\'t work because of ptsd but wondering if I should just suck it upHow did you manage to keep your job feeling that way? I could barely work when I had antidepressant withdrawalWhat dose you take? I got downvoted for making a similar post about lithium orotate but it helps a littleWhat if you panic for days on endYea I\\'m going thru one of the worst themes rn. There\\'s nothing I can do but wait it out like all the other themes I had in the past. Also personally antidepressants make me worseSo as long as I do the opposite of what my brain wants it\\'ll learn overtime?So rocd can change? This is a new thing for me that happened a few months ago. I\\'m just nervous because I haven\\'t seen my partner in monthsI\\'m afraid when my partner moves here to be with me my anxiety will be too painful and it will not go away.\\n\\nDoes this mean I am meant to be alone. My brain doesn\\'t want me happyOh I\\'m half Asian and when I was vegan eventually got sick and very anxious. I do well with seafoodI had a horrific time with a ex boyfriend 5 years ago where I had a panic attack for a week straight when visiting him. I don\\'t know why it happened other than I was off my meds for two months and was fine until that point and my ex is possible a sociopath.\\n\\nAny way it took me a year to recover from that and I met my wonderful husband soon after. We got married and everything was great until I got triggered by something that had to do with my ex last year. \\n\\nMy husband and I are long distance and he\\'s moving here and I\\'m terrified that the same thing will happen like 5 years ago.\\n\\nI can\\'t stop thinking about how living together might be a disaster and how I\\'m afraid i will not stop panicking and feeling like I\\'m dying.\\n\\nI don\\'t know what to do anymore. I\\'m scared of medication. can\\'t take antidepressants because of bipolarI just want confirmation that exposure therapy can take a long time though its extremely frustrating that its unpredictable in when it works for panic attacksYES it feels like I\\'m about to have a seizureI love my partner. He\\'s the only man I would marry in this lifetime. Unfortunately I have a lot of mental issues but they have nothing to do with him. I wish I could be lovely dovey all the time but it\\'s normal for people to not feel that way all the time.My therapist thinks I\\'m bipolar but these symptoms are almost unmanageable during my luteal phase when my ovulating is over. I feel like I\\'ve drank caffeine even tho I quit caffeine seven years ago. I shaky, irritable, paranoid and have racing thoughts. I only feel normal for one week per month if I\\'m lucky sometimes. Sometimes I feel horrible all the time.\\n\\nAlso I have pcoswhich blood types dont work with veganism? it made me sickantidepressants used to work for me but now fuck me up so yea im just screwed all overcool. weed gave me all those things 🤷\\u200d♀️I didn\\'t know he was suicidal most of his life. Is there a source on this?It literally ruined my life when I tried to medicate with weed. I\\'m still traumatized from the experience. Some of you all are batshit insane for thinking these drugs are any better than psychiatric meds. Its just as much as a roulette game playing with these drugs. You don\\'t know if it will make you better or a million times worse.You\\'re an actually idiot if you think bad trips are harmless. I have severe anxiety and panic disorder because of it. Not everyone becomes \"enlightened\" after a horror trip. Piss offSo fucking stupid my life is ruined because of drugs that make you trip. Please stfuThank you,  yes I\\'m not used to be happyWhen I went thru withdrawal I was unfortunately vegan at the time and I feel like it made the withdrawal a million times worse. I nearly died from itit\\'s better than vegan for sure lolToo riskyAh no not for me. I have bad trips from stuff like that it\\'s not worth the risk for meI wouldn\\'t give up. I saw a comment somewhere where a woman couldn\\'t orgasm too from PSSD but she said she orgasmed after like 6 years of pssd. I would also look into changing your diet see if that helpsLithium orotate is the only supplement besides l theanine that actually touches my anxietyThey\\'re evil. I\\'d rather die than be on that shit againI have a flare up of PTSD that came out of nowhere almost last year and it has a lot to do with my abusive ex and father. I think my ocd is making me think I\\'ll go crazy living with him. I just talked to him though and hes very understandingYea that\\'s pretty much what\\'s happening plus I have a ptsd flare up with ocd. I just talked to him and feel a little better but still nervous.Yea this is exactly what I\\'m going thru. I have severe ptsd from a horrible ex and my father so for some reason I\\'m projecting onto my husband who is an amazing human btw. Last time I saw my husband I was going thru severe seasonal depression and it may have triggered itI just dont get it.  Why do these pill do that when they are supposed to do the oppositeSeroquel made me buy a gun to put to my headMy life is changing for the better and yet I\\'m freaking out for nothingI feel like screaming. I don\\'t know why my feelings feel like they died for him. I\\'ve been waiting a long 5 years for him. I got so tired of the back and forth flying and cried every time he left. \\n\\nI panicked about us living together out of nowhere 3 months ago and I still have horrible anxiety about it. I don\\'t know why this is happening. He is absolutely perfect and he\\'s done nothing wrong.\\n\\nI don\\'t know if the long distance traumatized me or something. I don\\'t know what to doBothHow long you took it for?KalSometimesBecause I\\'m not the only person who lives in this countryI\\'m surprised there are not more people taking this stuff. It\\'s not like people don\\'t ever take lithium because isnt it found naturally in water and other foods? I think it scares people bc they immediately think of lithium carbonate the prescribed lithium, not the supplementNo that\\'s lithium carbonate,  lithium orotate is a supplementI\\'ve been taking lithium orotate for almost 3 weeks 2.5 mg everyday. I\\'ve notice I feel a lot calmer and my emotions feel like they\\'ve been reduced to 25 percent. \\n\\nIt feels too good to be true so I\\'m wondering if it\\'s just a placebo effect or actually working. I hope there isn\\'t a withdrawal to this. Is this supplement actually safe?\\n\\nI struggle with ptsd and possible bipolarI unfortunately have a body type where yes I\\'m small but I also lost weight and gain weight all in my stomach so I look skinny but pregnantI\\'m so glad my faves didn\\'t attendHe should have bought you a drinkUnfortunately at the time I didn\\'t have any backboneThanks. He told me I\\'m making it a bigger deal than it is lolI feel so bad but my husband insisted it\\'s not a big deal to him. He never wants anything for his birthday anyway. I can\\'t help but feel awful because I forgot his day. I\\'m so worn out from being long distance. It\\'s been a long five yearsWhoops I meant mr krabs without the shellYeaShame bc I could handle his lolI fucked naked mr krabs...not too bad lolYea if you\\'re in the rural the racism there is undeniable but cities are usually liberal and chillA one night stand I had told me I was \"kinda big\" and didnt like my stomach after he himself had lost 100 pounds and had sagging loose skin that I made no comment on. Personally I don\\'t body shame unless you do it first to me so...yea I had a big stomach and he looked like naked mr krabsAs much as that sub helped me relate to people I dont think the sub is appropriate like how bpdlovedones and NarssisticAbuse are bad subs that stigmatize mental disorders and suchI always go to trauma based therapists or trauma informed or whatever and it just doesnt work outI\\'ve been reading self help books on cbt and dbt and have been making some improvements. But I just wanted to say that therapist shopping is so exhausting as it seems they don\\'t really understand my specific trauma. Maybe I\\'m looking in the wrong places but I\\'m done therapist shopping for now. Tired of repeating my trauma story and just want to start healing now.\\n\\n\\nWondering if anyone else has managed ptsd without a therapist?9s are some of the most intelligent people I ever metWhen 8s are healthy its heaven when they\\'re unhealthy its absolutely hell lolI have two best friends who are 8w7 and 8w9 and they look like enneagram 2 a lot of times. They\\'re sweet, thoughtful, and very playful. I think their integration is my favorite of all the enneagrams because 8s still keep that level headedness and logical side when softening upBaseball bat and one hourAlso they got rid of subs that spoke out against the hate subs so I guess its freedom of speech on their termsThey got rid of all the terf subs but took them a decade to get rid of mgtow and the only reason they did was because the news covered itNah theres a lot of big ones in disguiseNot a disguised rant it\\'s a factReported. You all are responsible for the partial stigma that has been circulating BPD not to mention the misinformation that sub spreads. Reddit is not mental healthcare treatment and you all are not doctors nor patients on this site. If you are traumatized by someone seek therapy in person not armchair doctors on Reddit. \\n\"Most\" people with BPD are not terrible. There is no stat for this just anecdotal \"evidence\". Many of the members of bpdlovedones are misogynist and abelist and may even be undiagnosed with a personality disorder themselves. \\n\\nAnd disrespectfully get the hell out of here. Your abelism isn\\'t welcome here.Did you take it everydayYou\\'re right it\\'s a terrifying thought to end things but obviously anything could happen. But ultimately I know he and I love each other and we will try to move forwardOnly time it worked was when I got a shot from itI\\'m confused. You are feeling withdrawal from a 3 time use of benzos?Yea I\\'m so confused reading this story. Idk what op means by taking it 3 times in a year and it ruined his life?So that includes the mentally ill?So if they are mentally handicap and cannot comprehend basic things they\\'re going to hell?So how are they gonna accept jesus if they cant even speak or hearAlso coming off birth control felt like a withdrawal and it made me suicidal . I\\'ll never go back on themI am friends with people who show me consistent respect and show respect for people who give it back. For me personally I will feel myself go crazy if I constantly think about the unfairness of racism, so instead I focus on what I do have control over. I have control over who I speak to and who I let into my life. As a side note the white people I am friends with have done a lot for me and have stood up for me when I was in racist situations. Obviously I know they could step out of line anyday and that\\'s when I\\'d leave but other than that I\\'m satisfied with keeping my distance with people until they show me respectUnfortunately I\\'ve had panic and anxiety that lasted a year and thats why I\\'m terrified...because the duration was so long'"
